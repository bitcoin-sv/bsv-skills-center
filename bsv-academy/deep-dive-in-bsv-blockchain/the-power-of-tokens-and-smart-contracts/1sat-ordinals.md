### 1Sat Ordinals

1Sat Ordinals is a protocol on BSV that allows data to be **inscribed directly onto individual satoshis**. This innovation offers several advantages:

* **Efficiency**: Operates at the **single-satoshi level**, making it more cost-effective than other protocols.
* **Functionality**: Can represent NFTs, facilitate **smart contracts**, or support complex applications through linked inscriptions.

A notable application is the issuance of **stablecoins**, where transactions can occur at the cost of just one satoshi, providing a **scalable infrastructure** for digital currencies.
