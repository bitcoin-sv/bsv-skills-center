Proof of Work is often criticized for its energy consumption, but not all PoW systems are the same.&#x20;

BSVâ€™s **massive throughput capacity** and **real-world use cases** make its energy expenditure **economically and socially justifiable**.&#x20;

One of the most promising applications lies in sustainability reporting.

### Real-World Application

BSV's capabilities extend to various sustainability applications, particularly in **sustainability reporting**:

* **Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)**: An estimated **50,000-100,000 companies** will need to report sustainability data annually, and BSV can serve as a **single source of truth**.
* **Immutable Data Recording**: BSV allows for the recording, sharing, and verification of sustainability data across organizations, minimizing **duplication** and **fraud**.
* **Case Study - Port of Antwerp**: In this project, blockchain technology was used to track shipping container data, calculate **CO2 offsets**, and issue **digital sustainability certificates**, demonstrating BSV's **scalability** and **integrity**in supporting compliance and sustainability goals.
