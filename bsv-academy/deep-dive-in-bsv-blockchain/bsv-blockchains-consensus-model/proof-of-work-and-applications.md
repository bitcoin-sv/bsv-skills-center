### Consensus Mechanism

BSV employs **Proof of Work (PoW)** as its consensus mechanism, which operates through the following process:

* **Transaction Validation**: Nodes continuously receive and validate transactions before broadcasting them across the network.
* **Mining Competition**: Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, finding a valid nonce that meets the current difficulty target.
* **Block Addition**: Once a miner finds the solution, the block is verified by other nodes and added to the blockchain, rewarding the miner with a **block reward**.

### Energy Consumption

While **Proof of Work** is often criticized for its energy consumption, BSV's approach offers a different perspective:

* **Economic Justification**: BSV's high throughput capacity and real-world applications make its energy expenditure justifiable from both **economic** and **social** standpoints.
* **Efficiency in Operations**: The network's design allows for **efficient energy use** while maintaining security and integrity.
* **Sustainability Considerations**: BSV's energy consumption can be viewed in the context of its contributions to **sustainability** and **compliance efforts**.
