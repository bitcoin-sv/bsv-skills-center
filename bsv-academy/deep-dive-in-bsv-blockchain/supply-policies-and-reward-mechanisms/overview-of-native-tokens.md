# Overview of Native Tokens

The **BSV blockchain (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision)** supports **native tokens** that are integrated directly into the Bitcoin protocol. This design choice allows for:

* **Simplicity**: Developers can issue tokens without the need for complex standards or additional layers.
* **Scalability**: The BSV blockchain is designed to handle a **high volume of transactions**, making it suitable for token applications.
* **Low Fees**: Transaction costs on the BSV network are minimal, encouraging **frequent use of tokens**.
* **Security**: Leveraging the robust security features of the Bitcoin protocol ensures that native tokens benefit from the same level of **protection**.

Native tokens can be utilized for various applications, including **loyalty programs**, **digital assets**, and **decentralized finance (DeFi)** solutions.
