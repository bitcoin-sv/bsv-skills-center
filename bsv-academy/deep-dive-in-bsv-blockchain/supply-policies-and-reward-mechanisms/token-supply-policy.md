# Token Supply Policy

The total supply of BSV is capped at **21 million coins**, with each coin being divisible into **100,000,000 satoshis**. This results in:

* **Total Supply**: **2.1 quadrillion satoshis**, which is ample for global-scale applications.
* **Fixed Supply**: The supply is hardcoded into the protocol, ensuring that it cannot be altered or **inflated**.
* **Deflationary Effect**: The fixed nature of the supply encourages **utility usage** over speculative trading.

Distribution of BSV occurs through **mining rewards**, which are allocated to nodes that successfully create new blocks. This mechanism promotes a **stable economic environment** conducive to long-term growth.
