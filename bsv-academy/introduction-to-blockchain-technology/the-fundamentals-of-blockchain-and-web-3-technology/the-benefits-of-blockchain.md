# The Benefits of Blockchain

This technology has 3 major advantages that address the problems mentioned earlier.&#x20;

1. You have **complete ownership** of all your data within this network of computers.&#x20;
2. **No one can access your data** unless you grant **permission.**
3. **No one can transfer your data** without your **consent.**&#x20;

**You have total control!**

There is **complete transparency of the data**. Anyone can view the information recorded in this network and verify the owner of that data. This makes it possible to confirm that someone is the legitimate owner of a digital asset and, very importantly, to verify that the data is intact, meaning it has not been altered, and to know the exact date when it was recorded.

There is **global access,** which is one of the great strengths of this technology. Anyone can take part in it, whether as a node in the network or simply as a user who sends or views data. This is truly open access on a global scale.

There is also **trust.** This system allows business relationships to move away from emotional trust and toward cryptographic trust. Companies working together no longer have to simply hope that the data they receive is accurate, because it is immutably recorded in this network with a specific date and a specific owner. Trust is replaced by verification.
