Before moving on, it is important to understand an essential concept not only in blockchain but in technology in general. **This is hashing.**&#x20;

Hashing is everywhere and for example any antivirus software relies on it to verify files and detect malware extremely quickly.&#x20;

In simple terms **hashing transforms any kind of data, whether it is an image, text, or a file, into a unique string of characters that completely identifies that specific data.** If you change a single pixel in an image, a single letter in a text, or just one byte in a file, the code changes entirely.&#x20;

This makes it the perfect way to verify the integrity of data and when combined with blockchain it becomes a powerful combination. Blockchain is immutable, meaning that data cannot be altered or deleted, and **hashing produces a unique and entirely different identifier for any piece of data**.

Together they form the perfect system to verify information with complete certainty and without any possibility of error.
