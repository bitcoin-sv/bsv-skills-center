Before moving on it is worth understanding what tokenization is.&#x20;

Tokenizing something is actually very simple. It means **storing a piece of data** that represents something, whether it is text, an image, a document, a video, or a financial coin, and **giving it an identifier** that uniquely identifies that piece of information. It is that straightforward.&#x20;

It is simply a recorded piece of data with an owner.&#x20;

This data **can represent many things** such as something from the real world like a car or a house, something monetary like money, or something digital like a file, an image, a text, or a piece of digital art.&#x20;

To tokenize something simply means **transforming it into a digital piece of data and recording it in the blockchain**. As a result it will have a unique identifier and an owner who can transfer ownership of that data through the blockchain.
