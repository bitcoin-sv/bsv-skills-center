### Key Takeaways

#### Course 1: The Fundamentals

* Current systems centralize data and money, leaving individuals without true ownership or transparency.
* Blockchain provides a **decentralized, immutable, and transparent system** where users control their own data and assets.
* Trust shifts from relying on intermediaries to **verifiable cryptographic proof**.
