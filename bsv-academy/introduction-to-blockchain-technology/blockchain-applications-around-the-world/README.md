# Blockchain applications around the world​

This course demonstrates how blockchain is already delivering measurable value across industries—equipping you, whether you are a developer, business leader, academic, researcher, public sector official, or executive learner, with practical examples you can apply in your field.

**Key takeaways:**

* **Supply Chain Traceability** – Verify every step of a product’s journey with immutable, timestamped data; reduce fraud, improve compliance, and build trust (e.g., Ford’s component tracking).
* **Digital & Intellectual Property Protection** – Secure ownership, prevent piracy, and enable transparent transfers of digital assets and NFTs.
* **Gaming Innovation** – Use cases like HandCash show how to enable secure, cross-platform trading of in-game assets, creating new revenue models and player engagement.
* **Financial Stability & Global Payments** – Stablecoins (e.g., MNEE) deliver currency stability with instant, low-cost international transactions—vital in volatile economies.
* **Real World Asset Tokenization (RWAs)** – Digitize physical and financial assets (real estate, art, commodities) for fractional ownership, liquidity, and fraud prevention.

These examples provide **immediately transferable strategies** to solve transparency, trust, and efficiency challenges in your own sector.
