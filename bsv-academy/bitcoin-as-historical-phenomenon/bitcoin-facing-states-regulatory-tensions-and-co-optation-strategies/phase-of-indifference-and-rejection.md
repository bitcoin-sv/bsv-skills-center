# Phase of Indifference and Rejection

During the first years (2009–2013), Bitcoin was perceived as a marginal phenomenon, without real impact on the economic system. Authorities did not consider it a threat or a relevant instrument.

This changed with the appearance of the first media scandals and the use of Bitcoin on platforms like Silk Road. From that moment, governments' initial responses were predominantly restrictive:

·    Warnings about its use in illicit activities.

·    Direct prohibitions in some countries (China, Bolivia, Morocco).

·    Associations between Bitcoin, money laundering, and tax evasion.

These measures reflected a lack of knowledge of the technology and a defensive reaction to its disruptive potential.

BSV addresses these concerns with a focus on verifiable and low-cost transactions, promoting secure adoption for everyday uses.
