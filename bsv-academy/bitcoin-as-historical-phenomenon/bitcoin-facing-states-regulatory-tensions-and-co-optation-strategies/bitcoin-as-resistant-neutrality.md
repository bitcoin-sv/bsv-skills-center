# Bitcoin as Resistant Neutrality

Unlike other digital technologies, Bitcoin has no visible leaders, does not depend on central servers, and offers no single points of failure. This resistant architecture makes it an infrastructure difficult to suppress.

Any attempt at total control would require extreme measures—like censoring global access to the internet—which places it in a distinct category compared to other assets or technological systems.

Bitcoin cannot be co-opted in its entirety. It can be regulated, limited in certain uses, or imitated. But its operational core, based on open consensus and cryptography, remains beyond the reach of any singular authority.

BSV reinforces this neutrality with unlimited blocks for verifiable and practical transactions.
