# Bitcoin Facing States: Regulatory Tensions and Co-optation Strategies

Bitcoin was designed as a system radically resistant to state control. It is not issued by central banks, does not obey monetary policies, and operates without a validation authority. This decentralized architecture poses a direct challenge to the monopoly that states have historically exercised over money, accounting records, and oversight mechanisms.

In little more than a decade, the relationship between Bitcoin and governments has gone through different phases: from initial ignorance, to active regulation, and even partial adoption. This process has revealed a structural tension between two models of organization: the centralized one, represented by states; and the distributed one, represented by the Bitcoin network.

In BSV, this resistance is preserved with an emphasis on unbounded scalability, allowing simple and accessible transactions for beginners without depending on central controls.
