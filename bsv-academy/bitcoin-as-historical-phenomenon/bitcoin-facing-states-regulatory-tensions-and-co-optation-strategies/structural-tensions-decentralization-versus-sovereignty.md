# Structural Tensions: Decentralization Versus Sovereignty

Bitcoin challenges fundamental pillars of the modern state:

* The monopoly on monetary issuance is replaced by a fixed-supply system, without central intervention.
* The capacity to censor transactions disappears in an environment without intermediaries.
* Fiscal control is limited by the pseudonymous and global nature of the network.

This generates a dilemma: states can reject Bitcoin, but in doing so they stimulate its informal adoption; or they can integrate it partially, at the cost of renouncing certain structural controls.

In BSV, these tensions are resolved with a focus on unlimited scalability, allowing accessible digital sovereignty for all.
