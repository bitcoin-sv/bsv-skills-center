# Stage 1: Bitcoin as a Marginal Experiment

During the first years (2009â€“2012), Bitcoin was practically invisible to the traditional financial system. Its use was limited to technical forums, open-source environments, and marginal markets. There was no official quotation, no specific regulation, nor institutional infrastructure.

In this stage:

* Exchange platforms were rudimentary, informal, and insecure.
* Wallets were completely self-managed.
* There were no analysis tools, nor derivative products, nor institutional custodians.

Bitcoin operated as an experimental network without economic legitimacy or structural backing.

BSV maintains this experimental focus at its roots, offering simple tools for beginners to explore the blockchain securely.
