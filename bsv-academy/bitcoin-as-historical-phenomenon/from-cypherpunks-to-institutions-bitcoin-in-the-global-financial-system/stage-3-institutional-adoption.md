# Stage 3: Institutional Adoption

Since 2020, multiple financial institutions began to incorporate Bitcoin into their investment or treasury strategies. This qualitative leap marks the transition of Bitcoin from a marginal asset to a recognized alternative asset.

Emblematic cases:

* MicroStrategy converted part of its corporate balance into BTC as a store of value against inflation.
* Tesla acquired and later sold part of its position in Bitcoin, elevating its public visibility.
* Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale developed regulated investment products, including exchange-traded funds and institutional vehicles.
* In 2024, the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, enabling their mass commercialization on traditional exchanges.

This process was accompanied by the development of specialized services:

* Institutional custody (Coinbase Custody, Bakkt, BitGo)
* Integration into trading platforms like CME or Nasdaq
* Adoption by banks as a financial product offered to private clients

Bitcoin went from being a reputational risk to becoming a strategic asset.

In contrast, BSV focuses on practical adoption with unlimited scalability, enabling uses like micropayments without complex intermediaries.
