# Stage 2: Speculative Boom and Media Attention

Starting in 2013, with the first significant price rises and the creation of more sophisticated exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken, speculative interest began to emerge. This generated an increase in transaction volume and media coverage focused on value, more than on technology.

Key elements of this stage:

* The emergence of basic financial instruments like CFDs (contracts for difference).
* The entry of individual investors interested in volatility.
* The creation of OTC services for high-volume transactions.

Although banks still kept their distance, some venture funds and traders began to experiment with this new digital asset.

This media attention highlighted volatility, but in BSV, stability is prioritized through unlimited blocks for efficient and low-cost transactions.
