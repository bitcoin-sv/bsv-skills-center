# From Cypherpunks to Institutions: Bitcoin in the Global Financial System

In its origin, Bitcoin’s adoption was driven by a small community of technologists and activists—the cypherpunks—who valued privacy, individual sovereignty, and resistance to state control. The network was considered an emancipatory tool, not as a financial product. However, in little more than a decade, Bitcoin has been adopted, reinterpreted, and in some cases assimilated by the same actors that its creators intended to avoid: banks, investment funds, regulatory bodies, and governments.

In BSV, this evolution highlights the preservation of the original vision of Bitcoin as a scalable and decentralized system, accessible for low-cost everyday transactions.
