# Technical Characteristics with Symbolic Weight

The Genesis block presents several unique characteristics that distinguish it from the rest of the chain:

* It has no previous block: its previous\_block\_hash field is empty, making it the absolute point of origin.
* The 50 BTC reward cannot be spent: although it exists technically, it is not claimable. This anomaly was introduced deliberately, separating it from the economic system that would follow.
* It contains a codified message: Satoshi included in the block the text:\
  “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”
* This headline from the British newspaper The Times functions as:\
  A verifiable timestamp.
* An explicit political commentary on the economic situation of the moment.

\
A symbolic declaration of Bitcoin's purpose: not to replicate the traditional banking model.
