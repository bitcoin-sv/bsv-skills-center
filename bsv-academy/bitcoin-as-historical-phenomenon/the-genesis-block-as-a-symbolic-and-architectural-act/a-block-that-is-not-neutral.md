# A Block That Is Not Neutral

From an architectural perspective, the first component defines the system's rules. This is the case with the genesis block. It was not designed solely to initiate a computational process, but to establish a technical and ethical precedent that would shape the future structure of the network.

In this sense, the genesis block can be understood as:

* A foundational act that establishes the economic and technical logic of the system.
* A symbolic boundary between the traditional financial model and the decentralized alternative.
* A codified manifesto that excludes immediate profit, highlighting its foundational and ethical role.\
