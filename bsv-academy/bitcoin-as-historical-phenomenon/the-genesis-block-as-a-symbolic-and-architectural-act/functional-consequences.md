# Functional Consequences

The Genesis block not only has symbolic value. From a technical point of view, it is the root of the entire blockchain: its hash is transmitted, indirectly, to each subsequent block. Any alteration would invalidate the entire history of the network.

Additionally, the fact that its reward is not spendable introduces an economic measure of initial sacrifice. Bitcoin begins not as a source of profit, but as an institutional proposal without individual beneficiaries. It is a functional architecture that starts with an ethical affirmation: no one can obtain immediate benefit from the foundational block.
