# Economic and Adoption Consequences

Forks also have concrete financial effects:

* Coin replication: those who had BTC at the time of the fork also received BCH or BSV in equivalent proportion.Volatility: each fork generates uncertainty about legitimacy, technical support, and the project's future trajectory.
* User confusion: the existence of multiple “Bitcoins” complicates the public narrative and can hinder institutional adoption.

In the long term, forks can enrich the ecosystem by offering alternative options. But they can also fragment resources, divide communities, and weaken the coherence of the foundational message.

BSV mitigates this by restoring the original vision, with large blocks for simple and practical adoption in a unified ecosystem.
