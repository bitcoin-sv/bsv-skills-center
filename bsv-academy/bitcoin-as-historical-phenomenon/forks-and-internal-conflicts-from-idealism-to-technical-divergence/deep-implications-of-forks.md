# Deep Implications of Forks

Forks are not simple software divergences. They represent fundamental ideological tensions. They reveal disagreements about:

* What is “authentic Bitcoin”
* How a system without hierarchy should be governed
* What the priorities should be: security, efficiency, scalability, decentralization

In the absence of a central authority, the resolution of these conflicts is not political or legal. It is practical. Each network competes for users, miners, nodes, developers, and adoption.

The market, ultimately, decides which version prevails.

In BSV, this means a focus on efficient transactions for everyday uses, attracting new users with simplicity.
