# New Fracture: Bitcoin SV (BSV) aka the BSV blockchain

A year later, in 2018, a new split emerged from Bitcoin Cash itself. This time, the conflict revolved around:

* Fidelity to the original white paper of 2008
* The maximum block size
* Protocol governance

Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision) emerged as a proposal oriented toward:

* Implementing the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto literally
* Eliminating artificial limits on block size
* Turning the blockchain into an enterprise platform for data storage and contract execution

Bitcoin SV promotes unlimited block sizes, which allows for great processing capacity.

BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) focuses on restoring the original protocol with unlimited blocks, prioritizing real utility and scalability for beginners.
