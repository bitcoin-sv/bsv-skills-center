# Bitcoin as a Hybrid Asset

From 2013 onward, Bitcoin began to adopt a multilayered profile. It was no longer just electronic money or an ideological tool. It was, simultaneously, a store of value, a trust protocol, and a risk asset. This hybrid character can be structured into different layers of use:

| Layer        | Main Function                    | Typical Users                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Technical    | Decentralized medium of exchange | Developers, node operators           |
| Economic     | Programmed store of value        | Investors, long-term holders         |
| Especilative | Volatile high-risk asset         | Traders, funds, platforms            |
| Symbolic     | Tool of political resistance     | Activists, libertarians, communities |

This polysemic character is one of Bitcoin's great strengths, but also a source of internal conflicts about its future orientation.
