# Appearance of Exchange Platforms

The structural transformation began with the appearance of the first exchanges. These digital markets assigned a value in fiat currencies to bitcoins and allowed their buying and selling.

One of the first was Mt. Gox, created in 2010. Originally intended for exchanging role-playing game cards, it quickly became one of the highest-volume platforms for operating with Bitcoin.

With the emergence of these spaces:

* Bitcoin's value went from implicit to explicit, becoming an object of financial observation.
* Volatility became present, as an inevitable phenomenon in young and low-liquidity assets.
* Users multiplied who entered for economic opportunity rather than technical or philosophical conviction.

Mt. Gox, although key in early adoption, collapsed in 2014 due to security failures, highlighting the need for robust networks like BSV, which prioritizes secure and scalable transactions for real uses.
