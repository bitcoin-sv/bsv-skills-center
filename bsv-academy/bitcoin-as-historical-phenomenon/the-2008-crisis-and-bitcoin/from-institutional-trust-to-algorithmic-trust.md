# From Institutional Trust to Algorithmic Trust

**Comparison of the traditional model and the blockchain-based model:**

| Trust the bank      |      Verify on the network        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Trust the notary    |      Verify the digital signature |
| Trust the authority |      Verify the hash              |
| Trust the custodian |      Control your private key     |

**This change represents a redefinition of the social contract, where validation ceases to be vertical and becomes distributed.**![](file:///Users/lizettelouw/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)

**路    Personal data sovereignty.**

**路    Institutions verifiable through code.**

**路    Structural transparency.**

**路    New forms of automated trust.**
