# Trust and Truth in a Falsifiable Environment

**Trust is the basis of all social cooperation. However, today, tools for falsifying data, images, and discourse have undermined traditional validation mechanisms.**

**This means that tools like deepfakes complicate daily verification, and Bitcoin introduces a simple way to secure digital facts.**&#x20;

### Truth as a Structural Problem

Deepfakes, bots, algorithmic manipulation, and altered documents mean that veracity cannot be based solely on direct observation or institutional authority. There arises the need for structural mechanisms that allow verifying the authenticity of facts.&#x20;

### Blockchain as a Verifiable Solution

Blockchain allows veracity to be a structural property, not an institutional attribution. Each recorded event is linked to the complete history through hashes and validated by a decentralized network. This enables building public trust without the need for centralized entities.

In essence, blockchain acts as a public ledger where each entry is mathematically verified, reducing dependence on third parties.
