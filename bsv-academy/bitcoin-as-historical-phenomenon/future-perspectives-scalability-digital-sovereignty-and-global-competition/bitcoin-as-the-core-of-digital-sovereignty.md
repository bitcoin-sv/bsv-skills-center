# Bitcoin as the Core of Digital Sovereignty

Beyond its role as a financial asset, Bitcoin profiles itself as an infrastructure for exercising digital sovereignty in different dimensions:

* Individual sovereignty: it allows each user to maintain control over their funds without intermediaries, with phrases like “not your keys, not your coins” summarizing this principle.
* Community sovereignty: entire communities can use Bitcoin as an alternative financial instrument without depending on banks or governments.
* Epistemic sovereignty: in a world saturated with disinformation and digital manipulation, Bitcoin's blockchain represents a verifiable and resistant way to record facts, acting as a structural layer of truth.

In contexts where digital liberties are under pressure and money becomes a surveillance tool, Bitcoin offers an architecture that redistributes power and preserves autonomy.

BSV extends this sovereignty with simple tools for data storage and micropayments, making it practical for everyday users.
