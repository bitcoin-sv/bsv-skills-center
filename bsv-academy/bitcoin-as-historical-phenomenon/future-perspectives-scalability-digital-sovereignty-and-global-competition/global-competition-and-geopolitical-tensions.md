# Global Competition and Geopolitical Tensions

Bitcoin does not exist in isolation. Its growth has provoked diverse reactions from states, companies, and emerging technological networks. This competition can be observed in three main fronts:

* Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs): they attempt to replicate some technical characteristics of cryptocurrencies while maintaining total state control.
* Regulated stablecoins: like USDC or initiatives under the European MiCA regulatory framework, which seek to combine monetary stability with decentralized technologies.
* Alternative blockchains: like Ethereum or Solana, which compete with Bitcoin in areas like smart contracts, decentralized applications, and data management.

Faced with this competitive environment, Bitcoin conserves unique characteristics:

* It has no visible founders or issuing entity.
* Its protocol evolves slowly, which provides predictability.
* It lacks active governance or a centralized roadmap, making it a standard more than a platform.

BSV stands out in this competition with unlimited scalability and a focus on the original vision, offering a stable network for accessible global transactions.
