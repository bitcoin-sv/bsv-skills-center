# Coexistence of Narratives: Strength or Weakness?

Currently, Bitcoin functions simultaneously as:

* Speculative financial asset.
* Alternative medium of exchange.
* Distributed trust infrastructure.
* Symbol of political resistance.

This multivocality generates benefits like adaptability and growth in adoption. But it also poses risks:

* Fragmentation of the ecosystem due to divergent priorities.
* Confusion in communication toward new users.
* Conflicts over technical development and future governance.

For the expert analyst, this diversity of interpretations is not a defect, but a structural phenomenon that must be understood, evaluated, and managed strategically.

In BSV, these narratives converge in a unified focus on scalability and real utility, facilitating understanding for beginners.
