# Narrative 4: Bitcoin as Ideological Symbol

For many people and communities, Bitcoin is more than a tool: it is a political statement. In this story:

* It represents individual sovereignty against state authority.
* It is an act of economic and technological disobedience.
* Its use is a form of civil resistance against centralized financial control.

This approach connects with cypherpunk values, the libertarian movement, and sectors that promote monetary autonomy.

Advantages:

* It conserves the ethical and philosophical motivation of the project.
* It inspires resilient and committed communities.

Criticisms:

* It hinders institutional or regulatory integration.
* It can generate confrontational or polarized discourses.

In BSV, this symbolism translates into simple tools for everyday digital sovereignty.
