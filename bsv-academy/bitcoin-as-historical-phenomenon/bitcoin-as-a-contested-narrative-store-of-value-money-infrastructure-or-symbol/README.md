# Bitcoin as a Contested Narrative: Store of Value, Money, Infrastructure, or Symbol?

Since its creation in 2008, Bitcoin has adopted multiple meanings for different actors. Although it was conceived as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, its evolution has turned it into a polysemic phenomenon, with competing economic, political, technical, and cultural interpretations.

Bitcoin is not a unified narrative, but a platform on which different stories overlap. This plurality has been a source of growth, but also of internal conflict.

In BSV, these narratives converge in a practical approach, making the technology accessible for daily transactions without complexities.
