# Narrative 3: Bitcoin as Trust Infrastructure

An emerging vision sees Bitcoin not only as currency, but as a verifiable layer of truth. This perspective highlights:

* Its capacity to record documents, certificates, timestamps, and identities.
* Its utility as a base for smart contracts or notarial applications.
* Its role as a public archive resistant to manipulations.

In this narrative, the blockchain is an institutional architecture more than a financial system.

Advantages:

* It extends Bitcoin's reach beyond money.
* It positions it as a base for new forms of digital organization.

Criticisms:

* It competes with more flexible chains like Ethereum.
* It detracts from clarity in the monetary message and generates strategic confusion.

BSV strengthens this narrative with large blocks for practical and verifiable data storage.
