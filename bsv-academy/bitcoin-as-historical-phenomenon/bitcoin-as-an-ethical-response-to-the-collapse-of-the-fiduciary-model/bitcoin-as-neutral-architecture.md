# Bitcoin as Neutral Architecture

In response to this asymmetry, Bitcoin proposes a different architecture:

* Limited and predictable monetary supply (21 million units).
* Total absence of external intervention: no one can modify the rules or issue more coins arbitrarily.
* Validation of transactions governed by cryptographic rules, not political decisions.

This architecture eliminates institutional privileges and places all participants—nodes, miners, issuers, receivers—under the same set of immutable rules. In Bitcoin, no one is above the protocol. Not even its creator.

This technical neutrality implies an ethical notion: a form of algorithmic justice based on equality before the code, operational transparency, and individual sovereignty over one's own economic value.
