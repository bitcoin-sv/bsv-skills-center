# The Design as Ethical Positioning

Bitcoin's design, from its incentives to its rigid monetary policy, embodies a moral response to the imbalance of the fiduciary system. Unlike state money, which can be manipulated for electoral or political interests, Bitcoin is resistant to institutional capture.

For this reason, it can be affirmed that Bitcoin not only proposes a decentralized technology, but also a decentralized ethic: it is not necessary to trust anyone, because there is no central authority capable of betraying that trust.
