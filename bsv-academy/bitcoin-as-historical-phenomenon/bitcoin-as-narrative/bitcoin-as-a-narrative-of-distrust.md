# Bitcoin as a Narrative of Distrust

The emergence of Bitcoin was a direct reaction to the 2008 financial collapse, which exposed the fragility of the global banking system and the lack of structural consequences for those responsible. Bitcoin replaces delegated trust in banks and governments with mathematical verification and distributed consensus.

Where "trust" was once required, now "verify" is proposed.

The Bitcoin white paper was published in October 2008, and the network was launched in January 2009, with the genesis block directly referencing a newspaper headline about bank bailouts, symbolizing this distrust.
