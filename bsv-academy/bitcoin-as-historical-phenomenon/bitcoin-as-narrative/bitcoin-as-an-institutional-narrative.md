Bitcoin should not be understood solely as a cryptographic innovation, but also as an institutional and symbolic response to a crisis of confidence in the traditional economic system. From its origin in 2008, Bitcoin constitutes a functional metaphor for breaking with centralized structures.

In the context of BSV, this narrative is preserved and expanded to emphasize scalability and real utility, restoring the original vision of an efficient and decentralized electronic cash system.
