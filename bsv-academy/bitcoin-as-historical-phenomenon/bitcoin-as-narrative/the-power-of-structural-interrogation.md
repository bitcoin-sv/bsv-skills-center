# The Power of Structural Interrogation

In advanced academic or training contexts, it is useful to adopt an interrogative perspective. Some key questions for professional analysis may include:

* What does it mean to trust a faceless network?
* What kind of truth does a blockchain propose?
* Is an economy without intermediaries viable?
* What is lost when authority is replaced by algorithms?
* How does Bitcoin change the way we trust money?
* Can blockchain help combat everyday disinformation?

### Implications for the Multidisciplinary Professional

Adopting this integral perspective allows:

* Understanding Bitcoin as a cultural response to an institutional crisis.
* Interpreting blockchain as an alternative trust infrastructure.
* Valuing the impact of narrative on the legitimacy of decentralized technologies.

Without a solid narrative, even the most robust technologies can remain marginalized. Therefore, the symbolic component does not compete with the technical: it complements it.
