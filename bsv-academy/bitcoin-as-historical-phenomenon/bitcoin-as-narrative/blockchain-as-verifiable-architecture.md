# Blockchain as Verifiable Architecture

In this vision, the blockchain is more than a database: it is a structure of distributed integrity. It records facts in an immutable and verifiable way, without the need for central arbiters.

In an environment characterized by post-truth, digital manipulation, and disinformation, blockchain offers:

* Timestamped records
* Cryptographic reference to the previous (block) history.
* Decentralized validation on an open network.
