    B --> C[BSV Network]
    B --> D[Identity Certificates]
    B --> E[Transaction Signing]
```

### Supported Interactions
- **Authentication requests** - Apps can verify your identity
- **Transaction signing** - Approve payments and data transactions
- **Certificate sharing** - Selective disclosure of identity attributes
- **Permission management** - Grant and revoke app access

### Example Use Cases
- **DeFi applications** requesting payment authorization
- **Social platforms** verifying identity without passwords
- **Gaming apps** managing in-game asset transactions
- **Business tools** accessing verified professional credentials

## üîë Identity & Permissions

### Certificate Management
- **View your certificates** in the identity section
- **Manage app permissions** for each certificate
- **Revoke access** when no longer needed
- **Issue new certificates** for different contexts

### Privacy Controls
- **Selective disclosure** - share only necessary information
- **Time-limited permissions** for temporary access
- **Audit trail** of all permission grants and usage
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for attribute verification without revelation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Secure key storage** using device security features
- **Biometric authentication** (fingerprint/face unlock)
- **App sandboxing** to prevent unauthorized access
- **Automatic session timeouts** for inactive periods

### Best Practices
- **Enable device lock** with PIN/biometric
- **Regularly review** app permissions
- **Keep recovery key secure** and offline
- **Update the app** when new versions are available

## üîß Developer Integration

### For App Developers
If you're building web applications that integrate with Metanet Mobile:

```javascript
// Example: Request user authentication
const authResult = await window.bsv.requestAuth({
  requiredCertificates: ['identity', 'email'],
  purpose: 'Login to MyApp'
});

// Example: Request payment
const paymentResult = await window.bsv.requestPayment({
  amount: 1000, // satoshis
  recipient: 'your-bsv-address',
  description: 'Premium subscription'
});
```

### Integration Benefits
- **No password management** - users authenticate with certificates
- **Instant payments** - sub-cent transaction fees
- **Verified identity** - cryptographic proof of user attributes
- **Cross-platform** - works on any device with Metanet Mobile

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't connect to web apps:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify app permissions in settings
- Try refreshing the web application

**Authentication failing:**
- Ensure certificates are valid and not expired
- Check if app has required permissions
- Verify WAB connectivity

**Transactions not processing:**
- Confirm sufficient BSV balance
