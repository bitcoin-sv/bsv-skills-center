## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Backup Your Wallet

* **Write down your backup key** and store it securely offline
* **Test your backup** by restoring on a separate device
* **Never share your backup key** with anyone
* **The system uses 2 of 3 values to get access to the wallet:** If you lose your phone you can use the backup key. If you lose the password you can use your phone and backup key.&#x20;

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* Currently there is a bug where if you select the country, then type your phone number it reverts back to US after you've entered the phone number. Enter your phone number first then choose the country. If you don't notice this you might be waiting a long time for your SMS or receiving an error.&#x20;
* Incorrect password will yield a failure to decrypt message. Go through the account recovery process

### Getting Help

* **Community support** on BSV Discord and forums
* **Developer documentation** at [docs.bsvblockchain.org](https://docs.bsvblockchain.org)
