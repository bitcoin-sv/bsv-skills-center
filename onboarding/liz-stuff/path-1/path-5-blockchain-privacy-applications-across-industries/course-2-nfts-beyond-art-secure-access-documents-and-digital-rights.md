# Course 2: NFTs Beyond Art – Secure Access, Documents, and Digital Rights

### 1. Introduction: Beyond JPEGs – The Real Power of NFTs

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are widely known for digital art, collectibles, and speculative trading. But behind the hype lies a much deeper innovation: **NFTs as programmable, verifiable access tokens**.

This course explores how NFTs can be used to control access to **property records**, **academic credentials**, **identity documents**, and **private digital assets**—all while ensuring privacy, ownership, and auditability.

NFTs are not just about owning content. They are about proving rights, securing access, and building trust.

***

#### **Quiz – Introduction (Multiple Choice)**

What is a non-fungible token (NFT) best described as in real-world applications?

A. A digital picture\
B. A unique blockchain-based record representing ownership or rights\
C. A form of cryptocurrency for anonymous payments\
D. A digital file format like PDF

**Answer**: B

### 2. Property Deeds and Real Estate Access

Property ownership is typically recorded in central registries managed by governments or banks. These systems are vulnerable to fraud, error, and inaccessibility—especially in emerging markets.

With NFTs:

* Property deeds can be tokenised and issued to a blockchain wallet
* Ownership transfers can occur securely and instantly
* Smart contracts can enforce multi-signature sales, inheritance, or access rights
* All changes are logged immutably on-chain

**Example: Real Estate Tokenisation in Latin America**\
Startups like Propy have piloted property deed NFTs in regions where land title disputes are common. Owners can prove legal title without relying on a paper registry.

***

#### **Quiz – Property Use Case (True/False)**

NFTs can represent legal ownership of real-world assets like land or buildings.

**Answer**: True

### 3. Academic Credentials and Certifications

Educational institutions and employers increasingly demand secure ways to verify academic achievements. Paper certificates are easy to forge. Digital PDFs are not tamper-proof.

Using NFTs, institutions can issue:

* Degrees
* Diplomas
* Course completion certificates
* Professional licenses

These NFTs are **signed by the issuing authority**, **verifiable on-chain**, and **linked to the recipient’s identity**.

**Example: MIT Digital Diplomas**\
MIT issues blockchain-based diplomas that graduates store in a digital wallet. Employers can verify authenticity without contacting the school.

***

#### **Quiz – Academic NFTs (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following is a key benefit of academic credentials issued as NFTs?

A. They are easier to photocopy\
B. They expire automatically\
C. They allow independent, real-time verification\
D. They can only be read by the issuing school

**Answer**: C

***

### 4. Identity and Access Control

NFTs can serve as **digital identity tokens**—offering both privacy and authentication.

Examples include:

* Citizenship credentials
* Passports
* Proof of age
* Healthcare access tokens
* Digital work permits or refugee documentation

**Key Benefit**: NFTs can be designed with **selective disclosure**—allowing a verifier to check a claim (e.g. over 18, citizen of country X) without exposing full identity.

**Example: Civic and NFT-Based Identity**\
Platforms like Civic have explored the use of NFTs as reusable, self-sovereign identity tokens—allowing users to prove verified status across services without handing over documents.

***

#### **Quiz – NFT Identity (True/False)**

NFTs can be designed to store or reference verified identity claims securely and privately.

**Answer**: True

***

### 5. Secure Access to Digital and Physical Resources

NFTs can also act as **gates or keys** to unlock access:

* Event tickets
* Memberships
* Software licences
* Digital documents
* Physical assets (smart locks, cars, hotel rooms)

Each NFT can embed **conditions**—such as expiry dates, usage rights, or geographic constraints.

**Example: NFT-Based Event Ticketing**\
TicketMint and similar platforms issue NFT-based tickets that cannot be duplicated or scalped. Access control at the venue verifies wallet ownership, not paper or barcode.

***

#### **Quiz – Access Control (Matching)**

Match each NFT use case with what it secures:

1. Event ticket NFT
2. Passport NFT
3. Academic degree NFT
4. Smart car access NFT

A. Entry to a venue\
B. Travel rights and border identity\
C. Vehicle unlocking\
D. Educational achievement

**Answers**:\
1 → A\
2 → B\
3 → D\
4 → C

***

### 6. Privacy and Revocation: What Happens When Rights Change?

NFTs can also be:

* **Revoked** (e.g. expired licenses)
* **Reissued** (e.g. renewed visa)
* **Pruned** (e.g. personal info redacted)
* **Time-bound** (e.g. trial access to software)

Because they are **programmable**, NFT-based credentials adapt over time—preserving **privacy, compliance, and security**.

**Example: Expiring Healthcare Credential**\
A doctor’s blockchain-issued medical licence could auto-expire unless renewed. Hospitals would automatically deny access to systems if the credential is inactive.

***

#### **Quiz – Lifecycle (True/False)**

NFT credentials can be designed to expire, update, or be revoked.

**Answer**: True

***

### 7. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

As with all digital identity systems, NFTs must respect:

* **User consent**
* **Data minimisation**
* **Interoperability with legal systems**
* **Accessibility** (not everyone has a crypto wallet)
* **Right to be forgotten**, where applicable

**Example: GDPR and NFT Identity**\
To comply with the GDPR, NFT-based identity systems often store only hashes or references on-chain, with personal data stored off-chain and deletable.

NFTs are tools—not magical solutions. Their ethical use depends on **design, governance, and transparency**.

***

#### **Quiz – Ethical Use (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following is necessary for ethical NFT-based identity systems?

A. Requiring users to share full personal records\
B. Using private keys to lock access to their devices\
C. Minimising on-chain personal data\
D. Preventing expiry of any NFT

**Answer**: C

***

### 8. Conclusion: NFTs as Digital Trust Anchors

NFTs are evolving into **digital trust anchors** for industries beyond art. They allow individuals and organisations to **prove ownership, credentials, and access rights**—without relying on centralised databases or vulnerable paper records.

From real estate and education to healthcare and government services, NFTs offer **granular, verifiable, privacy-conscious control** over digital and physical rights.

The question is no longer “What is an NFT?”—but **“What should it represent, and how do we use it responsibly?”**
