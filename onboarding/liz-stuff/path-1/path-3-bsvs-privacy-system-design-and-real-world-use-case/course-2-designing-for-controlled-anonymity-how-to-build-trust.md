# Course 2: Designing for Controlled Anonymity – How to Build Trust

### 1. Introduction: The Trust Paradox in Digital Identity

Complete anonymity may sound appealing—but in reality, it invites abuse. On the other hand, full disclosure undermines personal privacy and invites surveillance.

The solution lies in **controlled anonymity**: a system where users are partially hidden but still verifiable when it matters. It protects privacy, preserves accountability, and builds trust through cryptographic design—not blind exposure.

Controlled anonymity is not about vanishing. It is about choosing when, how, and with whom to reveal your identity.

#### **Quiz – Introduction (Multiple Choice)**

What is “controlled anonymity”?

A. A system where all user data is permanently hidden\
B. A system that allows users to choose how much identity to reveal\
C. A method of linking all digital identities to national ID databases\
D. A technique to encrypt all blockchain data by default

**Answer**: B

***

### 2. The Foundation: Pseudonymous Accounts

In traditional systems, accounts are tied to real-world names and government IDs. But on blockchain networks, users operate under **pseudonyms**—cryptographic keys that serve as their identity.

Pseudonymous accounts allow actions to be recorded immutably without tying them to a known individual—unless that person chooses to link them.

This enables platforms to enforce accountability (e.g. banning abusive users or validating eligibility) without storing names, emails, or phone numbers.

***

#### **Quiz – Pseudonyms (True/False)**

Pseudonymous accounts can enable accountability without revealing a person’s legal name.

**Answer**: True

### 3. Tokenized Credentials: Trust Without Names

Controlled anonymity becomes powerful when combined with **tokenized credentials**.

A tokenized credential is a digitally signed asset that proves a user’s status—such as “verified user”, “certified nurse”, or “student”. It is issued by a trusted authority and stored in a digital wallet.

These credentials can be selectively disclosed in transactions, without ever linking back to the individual’s real-world identity.

***

#### **Quiz – Tokenized Identity (Multiple Choice)**

What is a key benefit of tokenized credentials?

A. They allow permanent data deletion\
B. They give full public access to identity documents\
C. They prove user status without revealing their name\
D. They prevent revocation of credentials

**Answer**: C

***

### 4. Selective Transparency: Show Only What Matters

Controlled anonymity depends on the ability to selectively disclose relevant information. This is where **selective transparency** comes in.

Users can share specific identity attributes, cryptographic proofs, or behavioural signals—such as “is over 18”, “is verified by X”, or “has completed KYC”—without showing who they are.

This balances privacy and trust in contexts like:

* Online marketplaces
* Voting platforms
* Credential verification
* Moderated forums

***

#### **Quiz – Selective Transparency (Matching)**

Match the scenario to the data that should be disclosed:

1. Joining an online alcohol delivery app
2. Posting in a forum for licensed doctors
3. Participating in anonymous polling
4. Registering for a student discount

A. “Is age 18+”\
B. “Has verified doctor credential”\
C. “Is a unique voter, no repeat submissions”\
D. “Holds a university-issued student token”

**Answers**:\
1 → A\
2 → B\
3 → C\
4 → D

### 5. How Blockchain Supports Controlled Anonymity

Blockchain enhances controlled anonymity through technical features such as:

* **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets**: Generate a new address for each transaction, reducing linkability.
* **Token protocols**: Issue credentials or statuses that can be independently verified.
* **Off-chain encrypted storage**: Keep sensitive personal data off the blockchain, while anchoring integrity on-chain.
* **Digital signatures**: Prove authorship or eligibility without revealing the author’s identity.

Together, these tools make it possible to act with **trust** while remaining **unidentified**.

***

#### **Quiz – Blockchain Features (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following supports controlled anonymity?

A. Reusing a single wallet address for all actions\
B. Broadcasting full identity data with every transaction\
C. Using HD wallets and tokenized credentials\
D. Storing unencrypted ID documents on-chain

**Answer**: C

***

### 6. Accountability Without Exposure

Controlled anonymity is not a loophole—it is a design choice. With proper structure, users can:

* Be **auditable** without being identified
* **Prove eligibility** without being profiled
* **Participate** without surveillance

For example, forum moderators can verify that each participant is credentialed (e.g. medical board certified), while respecting anonymity among peers.

Should abuse occur, users can be de-anonymised only under specific, lawful conditions—by revealing private keys or decrypting certain credentials.

***

#### **Quiz – Ethics and Control (True/False)**

Controlled anonymity enables lawful accountability while protecting user privacy.

**Answer**: True

***

### 7. Real-World Use Cases

Let us examine how controlled anonymity works in action:

* **Professional Networks**: Users prove credentials (e.g. lawyer, developer, nurse) without showing real names
* **Community Moderation**: Banned users cannot return under new pseudonyms if their tokens are blacklisted
* **Reputation Systems**: Users earn ratings and trust tokens without revealing personal data
* **Access Control**: Systems grant access based on verified traits, not identity (e.g. over 21, resident of X, has completed KYC)

These applications demonstrate that identity is not always necessary—**but verification is**.

***

#### **Quiz – Use Case (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following is an example of controlled anonymity in action?

A. A user sends unverified emails to strangers\
B. A bank shares full client records with retailers\
C. A forum allows posting only with a valid medical credential\
D. A platform stores all identity documents in a public ledger

**Answer**: C

***

### 8. Conclusion: Privacy With Principles

Controlled anonymity allows people to interact, transact, and express themselves **freely and securely**—without discarding trust, lawfulness, or responsibility.

Instead of asking “Who are you?”, systems built on BSV can ask “What can you prove?” and “Should you have access?”—without exposing unnecessary identity data.

In a digital age overwhelmed by data leakage and over-surveillance, controlled anonymity is the foundation for ethical, resilient systems that honour privacy without sacrificing security.
