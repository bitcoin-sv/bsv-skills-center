# Course 1: Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Beyond Payments

### 1. Introduction: Reimagining Peer-to-Peer Trust

Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions are often associated with simple payments between individuals. However, their potential extends far beyond financial exchange. The BSV blockchain redefines P2P interactions by combining verifiable identity, scalable infrastructure, and privacy-centric design.

Rather than relying on intermediaries or centralised platforms, users can connect directly—safely and accountably. From family remittances to collaborative financial management and digital content access, blockchain transforms what P2P can mean in everyday life.

#### **Quiz – Introduction (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following best describes how blockchain enhances peer-to-peer transactions?

A. It removes all record-keeping to protect anonymity\
B. It makes all data publicly visible, including private identities\
C. It enables secure, direct interactions without intermediaries\
D. It replaces P2P systems with centralised alternatives

**Answer**: C

***

### 2. Remittances with Purpose and Accountability

Traditional remittance systems are slow, expensive, and opaque. Fees reduce the amount received, and intermediaries can delay processing for days.

Blockchain-based P2P remittances solve these problems by enabling real-time, low-cost transfers. With features like programmable restrictions, funds can be conditionally released or tied to specific uses—ensuring they are spent on essentials like school fees or groceries.

A migrant breadwinner can settle family bills or send money back home instantly, while still monitoring or directing spending. Privacy is preserved, but accountability is not sacrificed.

#### **Quiz – Remittance (True/False)**

Blockchain-based remittances can include programmable restrictions that guide how funds are used.

**Answer**: True

### 3. Shared Accounts for Collective Control

Shared accounts traditionally require trust in a central custodian, such as a bank. On BSV, parties can maintain a joint account with built-in transparency and logic.

Each transaction can be recorded immutably, visible to all involved. Multi-signature arrangements and SIGHASH flags allow specific inputs to require multiple approvals or conditional triggers. SIGHASH flags let people decide which parts of a transaction they want to sign to lock in specific parts (like a condition for payment) but allow future participants to fill in the missing pieces, like the recipient address. These features make shared budgets—between spouses, roommates, or business partners—traceable, dispute-resistant, and customisable.

Control over access is maintained while personal privacy is respected through techniques like **HD wallets** (A type of wallet that creates a new address for every transaction, making it harder to trace spending).

***

#### **Quiz – Shared Accounts (Matching)**

Match each feature with its purpose:

1. Multi-signature
2. Transparent ledger
3. HD wallets

A. Ensures multiple parties approve before funds are spent\
B. Creates a new address for each transaction to improve privacy\
C. Allows everyone to verify past activity

**Answers**:\
1 → A\
2 → C\
3 → B

### 4. Content Access via Micropayments

Micropayments—small payments worth fractions of a cent—were not viable in traditional finance due to high transaction fees. On the BSV blockchain, however, they become not only possible, but powerful.

Content creators can monetise articles, videos, or music by charging per use. This P2P interaction eliminates the need for ad-based revenue models or centralised platforms that take large cuts.

Each payment is instant, transparent, and recorded immutably. Creators retain control, users enjoy flexible access, and the system scales for billions of transactions without sacrificing privacy.

***

#### **Quiz – Content Access (Multiple Choice)**

Why are micropayments now feasible on BSV?

A. The blockchain uses high transaction fees to incentivise miners\
B. Transactions are fast and inexpensive enough to support low-value payments\
C. All content is stored directly on the blockchain\
D. Only banks can approve each payment

**Answer**: B

***

### 5. Data Ownership and Controlled Disclosure

Beyond financial transactions, peer-to-peer also applies to data sharing. Individuals can issue and control access to sensitive information—health records, credentials, or creative works—without relying on central databases.

Using Merkle trees and public-key infrastructure, specific data points can be selectively disclosed. For example, an artist can grant temporary access to a digital file, or a patient can allow a doctor to view just one section of their medical history.

Privacy is enforced cryptographically, but the system remains accountable and verifiable.

***

#### **Quiz – Data Ownership (True/False)**

On BSV, users can share specific pieces of data without revealing the full document or identity.

**Answer**: True

***

### 6. Identity and Pseudonymity: Balancing Trust and Privacy

BSV enables nuanced identity management. Public keys are pseudonymous, but real-world identity can be verified when necessary. This allows for confidentiality without sacrificing legal compliance.

For example, digital signatures and encrypted channels enable secure **IP-to-IP communication** (Two people send messages directly to each other’s internet address, safely and privately without going through a central server). Users can transact, sign contracts, or share data while maintaining control over when and how identity is revealed.

Privacy does not mean invisibility. Instead, BSV supports unlinking actions from identity while ensuring a trail exists for lawful auditing.

***

#### **Quiz – Identity (Multiple Choice)**

Which of the following statements about identity on BSV is most accurate?

A. BSV hides all identities, even from regulators\
B. All transactions on BSV are completely anonymous\
C. Identity can be pseudonymous but still verifiable when needed\
D. Real names must always be used in transactions

**Answer**: C

***

### 7. Technical Enablers: SPV and SIGHASH

Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) allows lightweight clients to verify transactions without downloading the full blockchain. This makes P2P interactions fast and scalable—even from mobile devices.

**SIGHASH flags** allow fine-grained control over which parts of a transaction are signed. They enable advanced scenarios such as crowdfunding, escrow, and partial commitments in a single transaction.

Together, SPV and SIGHASH make decentralised P2P not only possible—but practical at scale.

***

#### **Quiz – Technical Concepts (Matching)**

Match the technology with its function:

1. SPV
2. SIGHASH flags

A. Enables selective signing of transaction parts\
B. Allows light clients to verify transactions using block headers

**Answers**:\
1 → B\
2 → A

***

### 8. Ethical Design: Confidentiality Without Anonymity

P2P systems must support ethical and lawful use. Unlike anonymous systems that obscure accountability, BSV prioritises confidentiality. Sensitive data is protected, but legitimate oversight is still possible.

Regulators can audit records when required, using provable Merkle paths and timestamped identities. At the same time, individual rights are upheld through selective disclosure and user-controlled keys.

The result is a system that respects privacy, supports legal frameworks, and enables trust-driven peer interactions in finance, governance, and daily life.

***

#### **Quiz – Ethical Design (True/False)**

BSV’s design prioritises confidentiality and accountability over complete anonymity.

**Answer**: True

### 9. Conclusion: Redefining What Peer-to-Peer Means

P2P is no longer limited to sending money between individuals. On the BSV blockchain, it becomes a foundation for trust, coordination, and privacy-respecting exchange across domains.

From sending school fees with programmable logic, to granting access to a video, to co-managing a shared household budget—P2P on BSV represents a return to direct interaction, without the vulnerabilities of centralised control.

Blockchain enables a future where privacy, utility, and accountability coexist in peer-to-peer interactions—far beyond payments.
