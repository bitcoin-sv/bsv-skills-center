# BSV Academy GitBook Restructuring Plan

## 📋 Executive Summary

Transform the current dense, academic-focused entry point into a user-friendly pathway selector that immediately helps visitors identify their goals and directs them to the right starting point.

## 🎯 Objective

Create a welcoming, action-oriented landing experience that supports multiple user pathways:
- **Metanet desktop wallet seekers**
- **Building blocks for developers** 
- **Documentation access**
- **Code walkthroughs**
- **Hackathon essentials**
- **Examples and templates**
- **Complete curriculum learners**

## 🔄 Current Problems

- README is too dense and overwhelming for new users (328 lines of technical content)
- GitBook starts with comprehensive system overview instead of user needs
- No clear pathway for different user types
- Academic tone doesn't match diverse user intentions
- Users must scroll through extensive content to find their specific needs

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Navigation Flow Restructure

    A[GitBook Landing] --> B[Getting Started - Pathway Selector]
    B --> C[Quick Actions]
    B --> D[Learning Paths]
    
    C --> E[Get Metanet Wallet]
    C --> F[View Code Examples]
    C --> G[Access Documentation]
    C --> H[Hackathon Resources]
    
    D --> I[Developer Path]
    D --> J[Business Path]
    D --> K[Academic Path]
    D --> L[Enterprise Path]
    
    M[Current README Content] --> N[System Overview/Complete Guide]
    
    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style D fill:#f3e5f5
```

### Phase 2: Content Reorganization

**New SUMMARY.md Structure:**
```
## Getting Started (NEW LANDING PAGE)
* [Choose Your Path](01-getting-started/README.md)

## Quick Actions
* [Get Metanet Wallet](01-getting-started/metanet-wallet.md)
* [Code Examples](01-getting-started/examples.md)
* [Documentation Hub](01-getting-started/docs.md)
* [Hackathon Kit](05-hackathon-essentials/README.md)

## Learning Pathways
* [Technical Path](02-pathways/technical/README.md)
* [Business Path](02-pathways/business/README.md)
* [Academic Path](02-pathways/academic/README.md)
* [Enterprise Path](02-pathways/enterprise/README.md)

## System Reference
* [Complete System Guide](00-system-overview/README.md) <- MOVED FROM README
* [Foundations](01-foundations/)
* [Resources](03-resources/)
```

### Phase 3: New Getting Started Page Design

**Structure:**
1. **Welcome Section** - Brief, friendly introduction
2. **"What brings you to BSV?" Section** - Intent-based quick actions
3. **"Ready to dive deeper?" Section** - Role-based learning paths
4. **"Need help choosing?" Section** - Guidance for uncertain users

**Content Approach:**
- Conversational tone instead of academic
- Action-oriented language ("Get", "Build", "Learn", "Explore")
- Visual pathway selection with clear outcomes
- Immediate value proposition for each option

### Phase 4: Content Migration Strategy

**Current README → System Overview:**
- Move comprehensive curriculum details to `00-system-overview/README.md`
- Preserve all technical integration information
- Maintain mermaid diagrams and detailed architecture
- Keep as reference for users who need complete picture

**Enhanced Getting Started:**
- Transform current `01-getting-started/README.md` into pathway selector
- Add quick action cards for immediate needs
- Include visual pathway comparison
- Provide clear next steps for each choice
