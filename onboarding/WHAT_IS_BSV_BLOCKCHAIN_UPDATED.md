# What is BSV Blockchain?

BSV (Bitcoin Satoshi Vision) is the original Bitcoin protocol, restored to follow the design envisioned in Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 white paper. It offers unbounded scalability, low and predictable transaction fees, native smart contract functionality, and a commitment to regulatory compliance and enterprise-grade stability.

## Key Technical Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Protocol Stability | Set-in-stone protocol ensures long-term application viability |
| Unbounded Scalability | Scales to millions of transactions per second (TPS) through massive blocks |
| Low Transaction Fees | Fees measured in fractions of a cent, even at scale |
| Native Smart Contracts | Use Bitcoin Script, sCrypt's embedded DSL within TypeScript, or token protocols like 1Sat Ordinals |
| Real-Time Data Processing | Ideal for IoT, gaming, financial services, and supply chain data |
| Native Tokenisation | Supports NFT and fungible token standards without layer-2 complexity |

## 🚀 Why Build on BSV?

BSV provides a unique development environment that combines:

### ⚡ Unmatched Performance

- 1M+ transactions per second proven capability
- Sub-cent fees (< $0.0001) enable micropayments and high-frequency operations
- Instant settlement for real-time applications
- Predictable costs with no gas auctions or fee volatility

### 🛠️ Developer-Friendly Toolchain

- TypeScript-first development with comprehensive SDK
- Familiar web technologies - build like traditional web apps
- Efficient transaction validation with BEEF (Background Evaluation Extended Format)
- Standardized Merkle proofs with BUMP (BSV Unified Merkle Path)

### 🔐 Identity-Native Architecture

- BRC-100 wallet interface for consistent identity management
- BRC-103 peer-to-peer mutual authentication
- Selective data disclosure for privacy-preserving applications
- Verifiable credentials for trust without centralized authorities
- Cross-app identity with standardized protocols

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Overview

The BSV ecosystem follows the Mandala Network architecture with three primary layers:

1. **Transaction Processors** (Core): Create blocks, witness transactions, distribute Merkle proofs
2. **Overlay Services** (Middle): Enable specialized tracking and management of tokens and data
3. **Transacting Parties** (Edge): End users with specialized applications that create transactions through wallets
