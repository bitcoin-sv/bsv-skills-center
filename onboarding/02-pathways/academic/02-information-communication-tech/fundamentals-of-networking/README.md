# Fundamentals of Networking

Networking allows multiple computers and devices to connect and communicate. This connectivity is crucial for accessing the internet, sharing resources, and collaborating in today's digital world.

## **Basic Concepts of Networking**

A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and scanners), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

**Local Area Network (LAN):** Connects computers within a closely contained area like a school, home, or office building.

**Wide Area Network (WAN):** Connects computers across broader geographic areas, such as cities or countries.

## **Key Networking Devices**

* **Routers and Modems:**
  * **Router:** Helps direct data across a network, ensuring that information sent from one computer to another arrives at the correct destination.
  * **Modem:** Connects networks to the internet, translating information between the internal network and the internet.
* **How Computers Connect:**
  * Every device on a network has a unique identifier called an IP address that helps in routing information to and from the device.

## **Why Networking Matters in ICT and Web3**
