# Important considerations

Turning raw data into valuable information involves several important steps, each requiring careful consideration to ensure the final information is accurate and useful. Hereâ€™s a look at these key factors:

#### 1. Integrity of Collection

**What It Means:** The data collected must be accurate and complete. If the data is incorrect or incomplete, the information derived from it will also be flawed.

**Example:** In a survey, if questions are biased or misleading, the responses will not truly reflect the opinions or facts needed to make good decisions.

#### 2. Processing Accuracy

**What It Means:** Once data is collected, it must be processed correctly. This includes organizing the data, removing any errors, and ensuring it is formatted properly for analysis.

**Example:** When processing sales data, ensuring that all entries are recorded in the correct currency and adjusted for any errors before analysis prevents misleading conclusions about financial health.

#### 3. Careful Analysis

**What It Means:** Analyzing data involves applying statistical or other methods to draw conclusions. This step must be done carefully to avoid incorrect interpretations.

**Example:** In health research, analysts must use the right statistical methods to accurately determine if a new treatment is effective, avoiding biases or incorrect modeling choices.

#### 4. Clear Ontology

**What It Means:** Ontology in this context refers to the specific terms and relationships used to categorize and store data. Having clear definitions and structures helps in making the data useful.

**Example:** In a database storing information about books, clear definitions of what constitutes a "genre" or an "author" ensure that searches and reports pull the correct and intended information.

#### 5. Trusted Provenance

**What It Means:** Provenance is about knowing where data comes from and how it has been handled over time. Trusting the source and handling of data is crucial for its credibility.

**Example:** If a business uses market research data to plan product expansions, knowing that the data comes from a reputable source and understanding how it was collected helps ensure decisions are based on reliable information.

#### Making Sure Information is Reliable

Each of these considerations is a step towards ensuring that the information produced from data is reliable and trustworthy. Without such diligence in each step, there's a risk of making decisions based on poor-quality information, which can lead to errors and missed opportunities.
