# Information

**Information** is derived from processed data that has been organized or interpreted to add meaning and value. Unlike raw data, which consists of mere facts and figures, information is data contextualized to aid understanding, decision-making, and planning.

**The Transformation of Data to Information**

When data is analyzed and contextualized, it becomes information. This transformation is essential because it turns raw stats and figures into insights that can be understood and acted upon. For example, numbers on a spreadsheet become a financial forecast, and readings from weather instruments turn into a weather report.

**The Value of Information**

Information is invaluable across all domains of human activity. It enables informed decisions, supports strategic planning, and facilitates communication across various platforms and media.
