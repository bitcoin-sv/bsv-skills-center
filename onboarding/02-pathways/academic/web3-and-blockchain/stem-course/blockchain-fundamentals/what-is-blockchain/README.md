# What is Blockchain?

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/QphJEO9ZX6s?si=2zm5WfyFuZGidsJ-" %}

Blockchain technology represents a transformation in how data is recorded and preserved. It functions as a distributed ledger that is both open and immutable, ensuring that once data is entered, it cannot be altered, which aligns with the principles of WORM (Write Once, Read Many).

## **Early Concepts Similar to Blockchain:**

### **Feet of Fines**

Dating back to medieval England, the 'Feet of Fines' were publicly distributed documents recording land dispute resolutions. This widespread distribution ensured the documents' immutability and public verification, echoing modern blockchain's approach to maintaining ledger integrity.

### **Haber and Stornetta (1991)**

* The foundational work by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced a system for using a newspaper to publish time-stamped digital documents to prevent tampering, laying the groundwork for what would evolve into blockchain technology.

## **Defining Blockchain**

### **Distributed Ledger**

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology where copies of the ledger are held across multiple sites or participants. Unlike centralized systems, this ensures no single party controls the historical record.

### **Immutability and WORM**

Via the WORM characteristic, blockchain ensures that data, once written to the ledger, cannot be changed, making it incredibly secure and reliable for record-keeping.

### **Transparency and Public Verification**

Blockchains are typically designed to be open, allowing anyone to verify the accuracy of the data recorded. This transparency helps in maintaining the honesty and integrity of the ledger.
