# Public vs Private

While "private blockchains" are often discussed within the blockchain community, it's essential to understand their structural and functional differences from public blockchain networks, which truly embody the principles of openness and wide accessibility.

## **The Nature of Private Blockchains**

Private blockchains, or permissioned ledgers, are controlled networks where access is restricted to certain users based on permissions. This gating fundamentally alters the nature of the technology, aligning it closer to a traditional database with enhanced auditing capabilities.

### **Limitations of Private Blockchains:**

* **Centralization Issues:**
  * Unlike more open networks, private blockchains have centralized control points, making them susceptible to alterations or censorship by the governing authority, thus compromising the integrity often associated with blockchain technology.
* **Lack of Interoperability:**
  * A significant limitation of private blockchains is their lack of interoperability with other networks. Since these systems often operate within siloed environments, they cannot easily connect or interact with other protocols or networks, which is crucial for the expansive, interconnected nature of Web3. This interoperability is essential for enabling seamless exchanges of data and value across diverse platforms and applications, facilitating the creation of a fully integrated digital economy.

### **Real Blockchain Benefits and Public Networks**

#### **Widespread Data Publication**

Public blockchains inherently distribute data widely and securely, making them tamper-resistant and open for verification by anyone, which is essential for maintaining integrity and trust in the data.

Advanced use cases include creating overlay systems that utilize the security and immutability of public blockchains. These systems can exploit the distributed verification mechanisms of public blockchains for sophisticated data management applications such as secure transactions, transparent supply chains, and compliance with global standards.
