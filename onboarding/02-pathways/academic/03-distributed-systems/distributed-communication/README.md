# Distributed Communication

In distributed systems, communication between different computers or nodes is fundamental for their operation. These systems rely on networked connections to transmit data, ensuring that each part of the system can function collaboratively and efficiently.

## **Basics of Data Transmission**

* **Data Transmission:** Data is sent between systems through physical and wireless network connections. This process is facilitated by various transmission mediums, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
* **Bandwidth:** The amount of data that can be transmitted in a given amount of time is termed as bandwidth. Higher bandwidth allows more data to be sent, which is critical for the performance of distributed systems.

## **Types of Physical Communication Mediums**

* **Fiber Optic Cables:** Use light to transmit data and are known for their high bandwidth and low latency, making them ideal for long-distance and high-speed data transmission.
* **Copper Cables:** Traditionally used for telecommunications and data transmission, copper cables are now often replaced by fiber optics in high-demand environments due to their limitations in speed and distance.

## **Incorporating Wireless Communication**

* **Wireless Communication:** In addition to physical cables, wireless technologies play a pivotal role in modern distributed systems. Wireless communication offers flexibility and scalability, allowing devices to connect without the constraints of physical wiring.
* **Advantages:** Wireless systems are invaluable in environments where physical connections are impractical or when mobility is required. They can be scaled easily by adding more access points or using different technologies like Wi-Fi, satellite, and cellular networks.
* **Challenges:** Despite its advantages, wireless communication can be susceptible to interference, security concerns, and typically offers lower bandwidth compared to wired connections.

## **The Broad Internet and Routing**

* **Internet Infrastructure:** The global network of networks, the internet, connects distributed systems across the world. It comprises numerous interconnected networks that use standardized communication protocols to route data to its destination.
* **Routing:** Data packets are directed through various routes on the internet, depending on network traffic, distances, and the availability of pathways. Routers play a crucial role in this process by determining the best path for data to travel from its source to its destination.

## **High-Level API Communication:**

* **Introduction to APIs:** At a high level, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the protocols through which different software components of a distributed system communicate. They define the methods and data formats for requesting and responding to services between systems.
* **Role of APIs:** APIs simplify the interaction between different software layers and services by providing a standardized way to request and receive data, abstracting the complexities involved in the direct management of network communications.
