# Module 3: Distributed Systems

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **Level**: Intermediate | **Prerequisites**: [Module 2: Information Communication Technologies](../02-information-communication-tech/README.md)

## üéØ Module Overview

Building on your understanding of ICT fundamentals and cryptographic concepts, this module explores distributed systems - the foundation that makes blockchain technology possible. You'll learn how multiple computers work together to solve complex problems, the challenges they face, and the innovative solutions that enable technologies like Bitcoin SV to operate at global scale.

Distributed systems are everywhere in modern computing: from the internet itself to cloud computing platforms, social networks, and blockchain networks. Understanding how these systems work, communicate, and reach consensus is essential for grasping how blockchain technology achieves its revolutionary properties of decentralization, security, and scalability.
