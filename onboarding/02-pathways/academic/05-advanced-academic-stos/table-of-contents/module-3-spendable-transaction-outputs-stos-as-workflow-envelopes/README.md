# Module 3: Spendable Transaction Outputs (STOs) as Workflow Envelopes

Spendable Transaction Outputs (STOs) in Bitcoin SV (BSV) operate as distinct, self-contained envelopes that transport data or value through a transaction. Each STO represents an individual unit, akin to an “envelope” in a postal system. Transactions serve as “registered mail bags” that can accumulate multiple STOs, each representing distinct workflow actions, approvals, or transfers. When finalized, the transaction broadcasts all enclosed STOs to the blockchain, solidifying them as part of a globally recognized, immutable record.

#### **3.1 The Lifecycle of an STO (Electronic Envelope)**

In BSV, an STO functions as a dedicated envelope that holds either value, a data payload or both. This lifecycle of creation, modification, and consumption allows STOs to securely encapsulate data in a traceable, structured manner.

**Creating and Validating an STO Envelope**

Each STO originates as an output in a transaction, capturing a specific value or data payload that can be securely transferred:

* **Creation**: STOs are created as outputs, each given an exact value or a data payload that is effectively “locked” until spent. These envelopes are isolated units, maintaining their own properties until consumed in a future transaction.
* **Validation**: STOs are validated through their inclusion in a transaction, which undergoes verification when the transaction is broadcast and confirmed by the network.

Once validated, STOs represent definitive value or data, transferable through subsequent transactions, without the complexity of shared states.

**Local and Global State Changes in STOs**

STOs undergo two types of state changes:

* **Local State Changes**: These changes occur within a workflow before the transaction is broadcast. For example, an STO can move between parties locally, capturing actions like approvals or comments.
* **Global State Changes**: When the transaction is broadcast, it requests a global state change, finalizing all enclosed STOs and registering them on the blockchain as completed actions.

The flexibility of managing local state changes within STOs before global commitment offers a structured approach to business workflows, enabling staged approvals without frequent network interaction.

#### **3.2 STOs in Micropayments and Data Transactions**

STOs support a variety of applications within BSV, from micropayments to timestamping, demonstrating their flexibility as reliable carriers of data and value.

* **Micropayments**: STOs can represent value in the form of tiny payments, allowing frequent, low-cost transfers. This enables scalable, pay-per-use models for digital content, services, and more.
* **Timestamping and Data Verification**: STOs carrying data payloads provide timestamped, verifiable proof of existence for documents, files, or events.
* **Data Notarization**: STOs serve as notarized “envelopes,” each securely encapsulating data that can be verifiably tracked on the blockchain.

In these contexts, STOs become core units in high-frequency transaction models, reinforcing BSV’s scalability and cost efficiency.

#### **3.3 STOs as Workflow Envelopes in Multi-Step Processes**

STOs are highly effective in workflows where discrete, traceable steps are required. Each STO acts as an independent, verifiable unit in a broader transaction that carries out multi-step processes.

**Examples of STOs in Business Workflows**

1. **Digital Signature Workflows**: STOs can encapsulate a digital signature applied to a data payload, representing an approval or endorsement. For instance, in a multi-step approval process, a party can unlock and sign an STO with a note indicating their approval, passing it to the next party for their own endorsement.
2. **Supply Chain Audits**: STOs can represent individual items or batches in a supply chain, tracking actions like ownership transfer, inspections, or quality checks. Each STO carries a unique action and, when finalized within a transaction, builds a complete audit trail.
3. **Document Authentication**: When a document requires multiple layers of validation, STOs can carry endorsements from different parties along with unique data payloads as they progress through a structured workflow.

These STO-driven workflows establish BSV as a flexible platform for verifying sequential, auditable steps while maintaining low transaction costs.

#### **3.4 Transactions as Registered Mail Bags and STOs as Envelopes**

In BSV, a transaction can be thought of as a “registered mail bag” that collects multiple STOs (envelopes), each representing a distinct action, value transfer, or data payload.

**Accumulating STOs in a Transaction**

Transactions consolidate STOs, enabling multiple discrete actions or approvals to be gathered before finalizing and broadcasting:

* **Gathering STOs**: Each STO within a transaction may represent a different approval, signature, or data payload. This collection of STOs forms a cohesive “mail bag” containing all necessary actions in a workflow.
* **Local Interactions**: While within a workflow, transactions accumulate STOs as approvals, endorsements, or data payloads are added locally without an immediate commitment to the blockchain.

**Broadcasting Transactions as Global State Changes**

When finalized, the transaction is broadcast to the BSV network, acting as a commitment to the global state:

* **Final State of STOs**: Each STO within the transaction becomes a finalized, registered envelope in the blockchain, permanently recorded in the immutable ledger.
* **Secure Chain of Custody**: Broadcasting locks the transaction’s contents, cementing each STO’s path through the workflow and creating a verifiable history of actions.

This approach allows for high-integrity business processes, where BSV transactions document each STO’s role and final state in an unalterable format.

#### **3.5 STOs and Chain of Digital Signatures**

While STOs don’t individually accumulate multiple signatures, they support digital endorsements as standalone units, with the transaction consolidating these STOs and representing the collective outcome.

**Digital Signatures and Chain of Custody**

In a workflow, each STO can represent a distinct digital signature applied to its data payload, creating a chain of custody for the process:

* **Sequential Endorsements**: For instance, in an approval process, a participant can sign an STO with a unique identifier or comment, which is then passed to the next participant to do the same.
* **Final Transaction Signatures**: The completed transaction encapsulates all STOs, each representing a verified step, to create an auditable, authenticated sequence of approvals.

By enabling independent approvals that contribute to a final broadcast, STOs secure traceability within workflows and enable clear accountability for each step.

**Ensuring Finality of Transactions with STOs**

Finality is achieved when the transaction containing STOs is broadcast, marking the definitive global state:

* **Immutable Blockchain Record**: Broadcasting the transaction commits all STOs within to the blockchain, ensuring each step’s integrity is preserved.
* **Registered Finality**: Each STO’s history, endorsements, and data payloads become permanent, preventing retroactive changes and preserving accountability.

Finality in this context reinforces BSV’s suitability for workflows that require transparent, tamper-proof records.

#### **Conclusion: STOs as Workflow Envelopes in BSV**

STOs in BSV serve as independent envelopes within transactions that act as registered mail bags, holding distinct steps, approvals, or actions required in a workflow. By supporting local state changes, leveraging STOs adds flexibility to business workflows, allowing for internal staging without immediate blockchain commitment.

This structure of STOs as single-purpose envelopes with transactions as collective registered mail bags enables BSV to securely capture complex workflows. This module sets a foundation for understanding how STOs can underpin efficient, traceable workflows that maintain integrity across processes and industries.
