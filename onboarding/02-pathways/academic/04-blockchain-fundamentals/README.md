# Module 4: Blockchain Fundamentals

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **Level**: Advanced | **Prerequisites**: [Module 3: Distributed Systems](../03-distributed-systems/README.md)

## üéØ Module Overview

Now that you understand distributed systems, cryptographic foundations, and ICT principles, you're ready to explore blockchain technology itself. This module covers the fundamental concepts that make blockchain revolutionary: how transactions work, how blocks are structured, how consensus is achieved, and how these elements combine to create a secure, decentralized, and scalable system.

You'll discover how blockchain technology applies the distributed systems concepts you've learned, uses the cryptographic tools you've mastered, and creates entirely new possibilities for digital interaction. This module focuses on the core blockchain concepts that apply across all blockchain systems, with specific attention to how Bitcoin SV implements these concepts at scale.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- **Master** the fundamental architecture of blockchain systems
- **Understand** how transactions are created, validated, and processed
- **Analyze** consensus mechanisms and their trade-offs
- **Evaluate** different blockchain approaches (public vs private, etc.)
- **Apply** cryptographic concepts to blockchain security
- **Prepare** for advanced BSV-specific concepts and implementations
