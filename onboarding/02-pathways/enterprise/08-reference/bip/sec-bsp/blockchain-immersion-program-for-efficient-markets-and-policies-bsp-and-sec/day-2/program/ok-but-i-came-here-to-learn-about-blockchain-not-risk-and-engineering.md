# OK But I Came Here to Learn About Blockchain, Not Risk and Engineering

* Computers are really good at copying stuff and deleting stuff, Bitcoin is a funny dance that computers do to create unique data, that is very computationally difficult (basically impossible to fake), that can only be updated forward in time (again related to computational hardness) and can only be theoretically reversed by court order and majority agreement of mining nodes (the nodes that create the blocks in the block chain).
* The math behind this, cryptographic math, the same math that secures your emails or your WhatsApp, works because solutions, based upon modular mathematics (the same maths used to tell the time) are easy to prove, but hard to calculate.
* Bitcoin is essentially a data check valve, a special type of database, whereby data can only be changed forward in time, based upon the previous information, the 'UTXO' set of transactions that happen over the Bitcoin network.
* The Bitcoin transaction ledger is permissionaless, which means that the data on it is no longer 'silo-ed', and for a small fee anyone can update the database.
* For further understanding of this cryptographic math, and this 'funny dance' that computers do to solve the handshake problem, we recommend visiting [BSV Academy](https://bitcoinsv.academy/) in your own time.

## Breakout Session

* Currently problems with databases in the current paradigm are siloed information, and that the ontology of the databases often drives markets, rather than thinking about how the risk data should fit together, in a statistically significant and effective way, to manage risk and market liquidity at scale.
* Given the brief summary of what Bitcoin does, the unique problem it solves with respect to how we broadly currently manage data, spend an hour in groups with facilitators, thinking about how Bitcoin could create better incentives around sharing risk data for a specific private market use case: real estate, gemstones, metals and ores, timber, or even oil.
* Facilitators will help to guide you, don't be afraid to ask questions. Think in terms of how you understand these markets currently working, how data is typically managed, what the supply chains currently look like, and think of at least one way in which Bitcoin can substantially improve both market efficiency and effectiveness, in line with the general premises of Human Rights, environmental and sustainability goals and so forth.
