# Open Banking

Open Banking means one thing for entrepreneurs, the Phillipines, according to best availabe data, [https://www.unbankedmap.org/](https://www.unbankedmap.org/) currently has two thirds of its population unbanked. But even by this definition, the complete picture is not clear.

## Breakout Session

[https://mybanka.eu/blogid?slug=what\_is\_openbanking](https://mybanka.eu/blogid?slug=what_is_openbanking)\
\
Experiment with MyBanka, which allows a user to display both legacy bank accounts and BSV balances through the use of bank APIs.&#x20;

Discuss OpenBanking and the availability of banking APIs in the Philippines.

From our discussions throughout the day, discuss what's missing from this picture in order to provide credit ratings, overdraft facilities, personal loans and so forth. Facilitators will assist you.

## Bringing it Back to the Beginning of the Day

* Without statistically significant risk data, it is impossible to provide people with credit ratings, and therefore credit. The most important part of banking, from a national perspective, isn't the ability to send and receive money, it's the ability for the national infrastructure to insure the population, using actuarial significant data, which provides liquidity for investment.
* Bitcoin is, on the surface, as peer-to-peer payment system, but as the most institutionally recognised thought leadership from the engineering and insurance industry states, as is corroborated by many fund managers and private market facilitators already, its best and highest use case is in improving the transparency around risk, in order to attract liquidity in order to manage risk better.
