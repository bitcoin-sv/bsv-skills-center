description: Target Personas and Learning Outcomes

# Assumptions

## Target Personas

* Those who are interested in managing and regulating systemic market and currency risks
* Those with an interest in understanding what blockchain and Bitcoin does functionally, as an engineering tool, with less necessary interest in understanding the mechanics of it
  * Need to know how to drive a car, and that the car goes, more than they need to understand what a carburetor is, or how to strip an engine
  * If the audience has an interest in the more technical aspects of Bitcoin, invite them to the Ateneo courses, or direct them to BSV Academy
* The problem with risk: most people view it as a controversial thing, difficult to discuss, bringing in the 'dark side of life', the bad things that most people rather wouldn't talk about
* Really risk is just variance, which includes both the best and the worst, the full breadth of expected outcomes
* The greater the the knowledge of risk, which is just variance, the better it can be statistically priced according to actuarial mathematics. What we normally think of as bad, which is risk, is actually good, whether it is high or low.
  * This reduces 'fat tail/Black Swan' effects
  * This attracts investment and liquidity

## Risk Neutrality, Meeting the Size of the Opportunity and the Size of the Sell

* Day 1 facilitates discussions around how blockchain can be used to manage risk and data pertaining to both material facts and material risks both at the specific and general level
* By the end of Day 1 participants should broadly be able to appreciate how blockchain can enable stable economic growth, and give the central bank and regulators a potential wealth of new tools and systems to create responsive, efficient and effective markets and policies.
* Day 2 is formed on the basis of Pareto Efficient Risk Neutrality, this foundation and basis aims to cover 80% of the available phase space for discussion and sales, by covering 20% of the most important and high stakes ground. This assumed strategy is in line with both best available understanding of theory and best available understanding of Calvin Ayre's intentions.
