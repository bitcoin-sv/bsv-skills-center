# Blockchain in Supply Chain and Logistics

_Introduction (10 mins)_ Discuss the role of blockchain and cryptography in improving trust, quantifying risk, and enhancing liquidity in supply chain management. Highlight the challenge of opacity, fraud, and unmeasured risk in traditional supply chains.

_Understanding Blockchain Applications in Supply Chain (20 mins)_ Interactive activity where participants are given brief case studies of successful blockchain implementations in supply chain. Examples may include food safety tracking, pharmaceutical traceability, or diamond sourcing. Discussion should focus on how these applications increase transparency (reduce opacity), enhance trust, and reduce fraud.

_The Role of Cryptography (20 mins)_ Discussion on how cryptographic concepts like hash functions and digital signatures ensure the authenticity and traceability of products. Highlight the role of these concepts in reducing ambiguity, measuring risk, and fostering trust.

_Group Exercise: Building a Blockchain-enabled Supply Chain (10 mins)_ Participants are divided into groups and tasked with outlining a basic plan for implementing blockchain in a given supply chain scenario. The exercise focuses on how they can apply the concepts of trust, quantified risk, and liquidity in their plan.

_Conclusion and Q\&A (10 mins)_ Summarize key points and open the floor for questions and discussions. Reinforce how blockchain and cryptography can help overcome hurdles and drive positive transformation in supply chain management.
