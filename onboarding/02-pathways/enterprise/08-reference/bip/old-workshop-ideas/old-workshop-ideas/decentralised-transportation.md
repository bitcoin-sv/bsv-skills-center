# Decentralised Transportation

_Introduction (10 mins)_ Introduce the concept of Decentralised Transportation, emphasizing how blockchain and smart contracts are creating disruption. Highlight the existing challenges such as lack of transparency (opacity), unquantified risk, inefficiencies, and absence of trust in the current system.

_Understanding Blockchain in Transportation (20 mins)_

* _Smart Tickets (5 mins)_: Explain how smart contracts can automate the ticketing process, eliminating the need for intermediaries. These contracts can be programmed to issue tickets upon receiving payment, thereby enhancing transparency and reducing risks and fraud. Discuss real-world examples like Tixguru and Blockparty.
* _Asset Tracking (5 mins)_: Elucidate how blockchain can track assets (like vehicles, shipments, etc.) in real-time, providing a tamper-proof log of the asset's journey. This enhances trust, reduces risk of theft or loss, and streamlines the transportation process. Cite examples such as IBM's Food Trust and Maersk's TradeLens.
* _Autonomous Vehicles (5 mins)_: Discuss how smart contracts can facilitate autonomous vehicles. For instance, smart contracts could be used to automate payments at charging stations or for tolls, enhance security by managing access to the vehicle, and maintain a tamper-proof maintenance log. Give examples such as Toyota's Blockchain Lab and the MOBI initiative.
* _Risk Quantification (5 mins)_: Explain how blockchain enables risk quantification in transportation through improved data accuracy, accountability, and real-time information.

_Legal and Regulatory Implications (15 mins)_ Discuss the legal and regulatory challenges of implementing blockchain in transportation, particularly with respect to autonomous vehicles and data privacy. Explore how these technologies can be compliant with existing regulations and potentially shape future ones.

_Group Exercise: Developing a Decentralized Transportation Model (10 mins)_ Participants, in groups, will design a hypothetical Decentralized Transportation Model that leverages blockchain and smart contracts. They should consider the key factors like trust, risk quantification, liquidity, and transparency.

_Conclusion and Q\&A (10 mins)_ Summarize the session, highlight the societal impact, such as the potential for seamless travel, reduced costs, and environmental benefits, and open the floor for questions. Reinforce the transformative potential of blockchain and smart contracts in the transportation sector.
