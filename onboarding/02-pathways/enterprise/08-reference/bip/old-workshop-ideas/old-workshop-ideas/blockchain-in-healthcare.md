# Blockchain in Healthcare

_Positioning_: Ideally placed after the session on Blockchain for Regulators. This will allow regulators to directly see how blockchain can be implemented in a highly regulated sector such as healthcare.

_Plan_:

* Introduction (10 mins): Discuss the potential of blockchain in healthcare, focusing on trust-building, risk quantification, and fostering innovation.
* Blockchain in Patient Data Management (15 mins): Discuss how blockchain can eliminate opacity in patient data management and improve patient care by providing a secure and transparent record of patient data.
* Blockchain in Drug Traceability (20 mins): Delve into how blockchain can reduce fraud and unmeasured risk in drug supply chains by enabling secure and trustworthy traceability.
* Group Exercise: Designing a Blockchain-based Healthcare System (10 mins): Participants can design a hypothetical healthcare system on a blockchain, thereby addressing issues related to trust, fraud, and innovation.
* Conclusion and Q\&A (5 mins): Summarize the key points, address queries, and highlight how blockchain can foster positive transformation in healthcare.
