# Blockchain in Infrastructure Development

_Positioning_: Ideally suited after the first morning session which discusses redactable contracts and digital identities. This can bring to life the ideas discussed in the morning session with real-world applications.

_Plan_:

* Introduction (10 mins): Highlight the role of blockchain in infrastructure development, focusing on trust-building, risk quantification, and liquidity of project executions.
* Blockchain in Public Procurement (15 mins): Delve into how blockchain could revolutionize public procurement processes by eliminating opacity and ambiguity. Discuss how blockchain can offer greater transparency, reduce instances of fraud, and enable better risk management.
* Blockchain in Contract Execution (15 mins): Explore how redactable contracts on blockchain can provide tailored visibility and enhanced privacy in infrastructure project contracts. Discuss use-cases where blockchain can bring efficiency and trust.
* Group Exercise: Designing a Blockchain-enabled Infrastructure Project (15 mins): Participants can design a hypothetical infrastructure project that uses blockchain for procurement and contract execution, thereby addressing issues related to trust, ambiguity, and risk.
* Conclusion and Q\&A (5 mins): Summarize the key points, address queries, and highlight how blockchain can foster positive transformation in infrastructure development.
