# Copyright

**Satoshi’s Initial Copyright and the MIT License:** Satoshi Nakamoto, when introducing Bitcoin, also released the seminal white paper and the original software. The white paper, a foundational document, was copyrighted by Satoshi, establishing a legal claim over the intellectual property of the concept. Alongside, the software was released under the MIT License, known for its permissive nature, allowing users broad freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software. However, this license did not extend to relinquish Satoshi's rights over the underlying intellectual content, particularly the database and its structure.

**Dr Craig S Wright's Copyright Claim:** Dr. Craig Wright, who was doxxed as Satoshi Nakamoto by Wired and Gizmodo in 2016, was later awarded the copyright for the Bitcoin white paper and the original version of the Bitcoin software by the U.S. Copyright Office. This recognition was significant as it solidified a legal acknowledgement of Wright's claim over the foundational elements of Bitcoin.

**Enforcement Actions:** In a notable development, Wright enforced this copyright claim against Cobra, the pseudonymous operator of bitcoin.org, a website initially started by Satoshi but later came under the control of individuals aligned with the BTC core group. Wright’s legal actions led to the court ordering the removal of the Bitcoin white paper from bitcoin.org. This was a landmark moment, highlighting the legal strength of Wright's copyright claim and its implications for the control and distribution of Bitcoin’s original documentation.
