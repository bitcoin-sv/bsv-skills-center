# Historical Context

**Historical Context of Bitcoin's Development and Governance**

Bitcoin, since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto, has undergone a remarkable journey, both in terms of technological advancement and governance. Initially, the Bitcoin repository was hosted on SourceForge, with Satoshi at the helm, steering the project's early direction. This period is significant as it laid the foundational principles and governance structure of the project.

As Bitcoin gained traction, the need for a more collaborative development environment led to the migration of its codebase to GitHub. This transition was overseen by Gavin Andresen, who was then a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and seen as a steward of Satoshi’s vision. The move to GitHub marked a new era in Bitcoin's development, facilitating broader participation from developers worldwide.

**The Coup d'État by BTC Core Developers**

This era of expansion and collaboration, however, soon faced its challenges. A pivotal moment in Bitcoin's history was the emergence of divergent visions within the core development team. Figures like Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell became influential in the project’s direction, leading to significant shifts in governance and development priorities.

The most contentious development during this period was the effective sidelining of Gavin Andresen and the subsequent commandeering of the project by the BTC core developers. This power shift represented more than just a change in leadership; it was a fundamental shift in the project's governance philosophy and alignment with Satoshi's original vision.

This coup d'état by the BTC core developers was not just a political maneuver within the community but had deep-seated implications for the project's legal and ethical foundations. The removal of Satoshi's copyright attribution from the Bitcoin software during this transition was a clear deviation from the established norms and legal principles under which the project was initiated.
