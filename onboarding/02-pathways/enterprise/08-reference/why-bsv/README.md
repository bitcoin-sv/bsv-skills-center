# What is a Protocol?

In the realm of blockchain and digital assets, understanding what constitutes a 'protocol' is fundamental. A protocol, in the context of computer science and telecommunications, is a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. It dictates how data is formatted, transmitted, and received, ensuring reliable and consistent communication in a network. In blockchain technology, a protocol is even more significant as it not only governs data transmission but also defines the operational rules and consensus mechanisms of the network.

When Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, referred to Bitcoin as a protocol, he underscored the inherent characteristics of the system that go beyond just a digital asset or a software application. Bitcoin, at its core, is a set of predetermined rules and operations that govern how transactions are processed, validated, and recorded on the blockchain. These rules encompass aspects like the distribution of fresh bitcoins through mining, the format of transactions, the size of data payloads, and the consensus mechanism that maintains the network's integrity and security.

Central to Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin was the concept of a protocol "set in stone." This notion is pivotal to understanding the essence of Bitcoin as envisaged by its creator. When Satoshi released the initial codebase for the Bitcoin node client, he effectively laid down a foundational protocol that was intended to remain unchanged. This unchangeability is not a mere technicality but a fundamental attribute of Bitcoin. By declaring the core design as "set in stone," Satoshi created a unilateral agreement with all participants of the network, conveyed through his writings and, most notably, the Bitcoin white paper, which serves as a technical manifesto.

This agreement implies that miners who choose to engage with the Bitcoin network are consenting, by their mere performance alone, to the rules and operations as defined in the original protocol. It establishes a clear expectation that the fundamental aspects of the network are not subject to alteration. The significance of this cannot be overstated. In a landscape where digital assets and platforms are often subject to continual changes and upgrades, BSV's protocol stability offers a unique value proposition. It assures participants of consistency and predictability in the network's operations, which is essential for long-term planning and investment.

The unchangeability of Bitcoin's protocol is  reinforced by the meticulous documentation and stewardship by the BSV Blockchain Association (BSVA). By clearly defining and upholding the original protocol, the BSVA ensures that the foundational principles and mechanics of Bitcoin are preserved. This adherence is not just a matter of honoring Satoshi's original vision but is also a legally binding commitment to maintain the protocol as defined at Bitcoin's inception.
