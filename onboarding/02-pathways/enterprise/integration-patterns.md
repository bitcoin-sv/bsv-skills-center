    );
    
    if (!certStatus.valid) {
      throw new Error('Invalid professional certification');
    }
    
    // Create movement record with professional certification
    const movementRecord = {
      productId: product.id,
      fromLocation: from.id,
      toLocation: to.id,
      certifyingProfessional: certifyingProfessional.id,
      certificationStatus: certStatus,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      qualityChecks: await this.qualityAPI.getQualityChecks(product.id)

    // Record on BSV blockchain
    const txid = await this.bsvAPI.submitTransaction({
      type: 'PRODUCT_MOVEMENT',
      data: movementRecord
    });
    
    // Update inventory system
    await this.inventoryAPI.updateProductLocation(product.id, to.id);
    
    return {
      txid,
      movementRecord,
      networkEffects: await this.calculateNetworkEffects(movementRecord)

    const product = await this.parseProductQRCode(productQRCode);
    const toLocation = await this.parseLocationQRCode(toLocationQRCode);
    const professional = await this.validateProfessional(professionalCredentials);
    
    // Get current location
    const fromLocation = await this.getCurrentLocation(product.id);
    
    // Record movement with professional certification
    const result = await this.processAPI.recordProductMovement(
      product, 
      fromLocation, 
      toLocation, 
      professional
    );
    
    // Return mobile-optimized response
    return {
      success: true,
      productName: product.name,
      newLocation: toLocation.name,
      professionalName: professional.name,
      certificationValid: true,
      confirmationCode: result.txid.substring(0, 8),
      networkValue: this.formatNetworkValue(result.networkEffects),
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
  }
  
  private formatNetworkValue(effects: NetworkEffects): string {
    const totalValue = effects.sharedVerificationSavings + 
                     effects.riskIntelligenceValue + 
                     effects.complianceEfficiencyGains;
    return `$${totalValue.toFixed(2)} network value created`;
  }
}
```

## Event-Driven Integration with BSV

  constructor(eventBus: EventBus, bsvAPI: BSVSystemAPI) {
    this.eventBus = eventBus;
    this.bsvAPI = bsvAPI;
    
    // Subscribe to BSV blockchain events
    this.subscribeToBlockchainEvents();
  }
  
  private subscribeToBlockchainEvents(): void {
    // Subscribe to professional certification events
    this.bsvAPI.subscribeToEvents('PROFESSIONAL_CERTIFICATION', (event) => {

      liabilityInsurance: event.liabilityInsurance,
      timestamp: event.timestamp
    };
    
    // Publish to enterprise event bus
    await this.eventBus.publish('professional.certification.updated', certificationUpdate);
    
    // Calculate network effects
    const networkEffects = await this.calculateCertificationNetworkEffects(event);
    await this.eventBus.publish('network.effects.certification', networkEffects);
  }
  
  private async handleRiskAssessmentEvent(event: RiskAssessmentEvent): Promise<void> {
    // Process risk assessment update
    const riskUpdate = {
      assessmentId: event.assessmentId,
      entityId: event.entityId,
      riskLevel: event.riskLevel,
      riskFactors: event.riskFactors,
      assessingProfessional: event.assessingProfessional,
      timestamp: event.timestamp
    };
    
    // Publish to enterprise event bus
    await this.eventBus.publish('risk.assessment.updated', riskUpdate);
    
    // Share risk intelligence with network
    const riskIntelligence = await this.generateRiskIntelligence(event);

    // Verify with certification body
    const verification = await this.certificationRegistry.verify(
      licenseId,
      certificationBody
    );
    
    if (!verification.valid) {
      throw new Error('Invalid certification');
    }

      data: certificationRecord
    });
    
    // Calculate network value created
    const networkValue = await this.calculateNetworkValue(certificationRecord);
    
    return {
      txid,
      certificationRecord,
      networkValue,
      sharedBenefits: await this.calculateSharedBenefits(certificationRecord)

  private async calculateNetworkValue(record: CertificationRecord): Promise<NetworkValue> {
    // Calculate value created for all network participants
    const participantCount = await this.getNetworkParticipantCount();
    const verificationCost = 500; // Cost of individual verification
    const sharedSavings = verificationCost * (participantCount - 1);
    
    return {
      sharedVerificationSavings: sharedSavings,
      riskReductionValue: await this.calculateRiskReduction(record),
      complianceEfficiencyGains: await this.calculateComplianceGains(record),
