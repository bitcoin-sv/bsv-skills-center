#### Module 7 Structure & Content

**Chapter 1: Technical Structure of Overlay Services and Use Cases**

**1.1 Overview of Overlay Service Types**

* **Private vs. Ring-Fenced Overlays**: Explore the types of overlays, focusing on how to set up access-specific environments.
  * **Private Overlay**: For closed networks, such as a merchant-specific environment, where data access is exclusive.
  * **Ring-Fenced Overlay**: Allows for partially restricted access, ideal for semi-closed networks like a financial institution’s ecosystem involving multiple third parties.
* **Public Overlay**: A broad-use overlay where open access is required, providing transparency but with minimal access control.

**Use Case Insight**:

* **Payment Companies**: For payment companies, a **Private Overlay** can provide exclusive access, meaning only merchant customers access the payment company’s ecosystem without external interference.
* **Technical Differentiation**: Ring-fenced overlays would be an ideal choice for a company needing a layer of restricted access while still integrating broader data access with specific permissions. This setup might be chosen if the company partners with third parties, such as processing institutions or regulatory auditors.

**1.2 Overlay Service Technical Setup**

* **Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms**: Implementing STO storage for value and data management. Demonstrate how each STO functions as a secure, verifiable unit within the overlay, accessible only under designated conditions.
* **Merkle Paths for Integrity Checks**: Every STO and transaction is associated with a Merkle proof to ensure validity in a lightweight, decentralized manner.
* **Universal Hash Resolution Protocol (UHRP)**: Introduces UHRP as a mechanism similar to CDNs, where hash-based resolution can manage data references, enhancing retrieval efficiency without compromising security.

**Answer to Solling’s Question 1 and 2**:

* A **Private Overlay** is the likely choice for a payment company as it confines access exclusively to the company and its merchants. However, if limited third-party access is required, a **Ring-Fenced Overlay** offers a solution by adding restricted access points within a closed ecosystem. The module content here will support learners in identifying and setting up these configurations in real-world applications.

**Chapter 2: Building Early-Stage Overlay Services with ARC and SV Node**

**2.1 ARC Integration Without Dependency on Teranode**

* **Understanding ARC (Advanced RPC) Instances**: ARC allows overlay services to integrate with the existing BSV network through SV Node. By communicating with ARC instances, companies can process transactions, submit blocks, and receive verification without requiring the full-scale Teranode.
* **SV Node as an Interim Solution**: The module clarifies how SV Node provides full functionality for overlay service needs, handling transaction delivery and processing while maintaining compatibility with ARC.
* **Going Live Before Teranode**: Learners will see practical examples of how ARC allows for deploying products today, even as Teranode develops, allowing early access to overlay benefits and smooth scaling once Teranode is in place.

**2.2 Preparing for Mandala Upgrade Components**

* **Timeline and Readiness Check**: A detailed overview of anticipated milestones and which core components from the Mandala upgrade will be essential for payment companies.
  * **Development**: Using BSVA open-source components.
  * **Testing**: Validation against various network requirements.
  * **Production**: Final integration and scaling with Teranode as it becomes available.

**Answer to Solling’s Questions 4 and 5**:

* The course explains how companies can build and deploy overlay services with ARC and SV Node now, making full-scale production possible without Teranode. The content also addresses the benefits and limitations of running pre-Teranode, preparing companies for seamless migration to Teranode once available.

**Chapter 3: Managing SPV and Non-SPV Transactions in Overlay Services**

**3.1 Integrating SPV in Overlay Services**

* **SPV for Lightweight Verification**: SPV nodes operate without requiring full blockchain access, ideal for merchant networks within a payment company’s ecosystem.
* **Merkle Proof and Header Verification**: Explains how overlays use Merkle proofs to confirm transactions within a private or ring-fenced setting, allowing merchants to validate data independently.

**3.2 Handling Transactions from Non-SPV Wallets**

* **Alternate Verification Solutions**: For non-SPV wallets, options include fetching Merkle proofs from external overlay services or using ARC nodes to validate transaction validity.
* **Practical Implementation**: Step-by-step guidance on configuring ARC instances to receive external Merkle proofs and confirm the validity of non-SPV wallet transactions.

**Answer to Solling’s Question 6**:

* The course addresses how overlay services can integrate with non-SPV wallets, providing learners with practical solutions for alternative verification and ensuring compatibility with a diverse range of transaction sources.

**Chapter 4: Configuring and Deploying Payment Solutions in Overlay Services**

**4.1 STO Workflow and Transaction Management**

* **Modular STO Lifecycle Management**: From issuance to reissuance and finalization, students will manage STOs through the overlay environment, applying both private and ring-fenced protocols to track transaction states.
* **Digital Signatures and Finality**: Understanding how STOs manage signature chains to ensure traceability and finality, with verification mechanisms that minimize dependency on miners.

**4.2 Overlay Services and Atomic Transaction Security**

* **Atomic Operations**: Ensuring that entire workflows either succeed or fail together, critical for financial transactions where multiple dependencies must be satisfied.
* **Private and Shared State Transitions**: Handling STOs in workflows that involve multiple merchants or segments, using ring-fenced overlays to compartmentalize STO states.

**Answer to Solling’s Question 3**:

* The technical difference between a private overlay and a ring-fenced overlay lies in access boundaries: private overlays are isolated to internal company stakeholders, while ring-fenced overlays permit restricted, controlled access to specific external stakeholders, maintaining secure and compartmentalized data channels.

**Chapter 5: Universal Hash Resolution Protocol (UHRP) for Scalable Data Storage**

**5.1 Overview of UHRP in Data-Heavy Applications**

* **Data Resolution Similar to CDNs**: Using hash-based retrieval to quickly and securely access transaction data, UHRP enables overlays to manage data payloads with efficient, permissioned access.
* **Implementing Secure Access Controls**: UHRP allows overlays to securely index and retrieve data without exposing raw data on-chain, supporting privacy and regulatory compliance.

**5.2 Configuring UHRP for Payment Companies**

* **Private and Ring-Fenced UHRP Setups**: Configuring UHRP to support payment company requirements, such as secure merchant verification, controlled access, and audit trails.
* **Integrating UHRP with Overlay Services for Compliance**: Enabling transparent, secure access for regulatory audits, but restricting open data exposure, fulfilling privacy mandates and business logic requirements.
