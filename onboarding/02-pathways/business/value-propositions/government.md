## Getting Started

### Assessment Questions

1. What government records require the highest levels of security and integrity?
2. How do your agencies currently share information while maintaining compliance?
3. What manual processes consume the most resources in your operations?
4. How do you currently ensure transparency and accountability to the public?
5. What legacy systems are most critical for modernization?
