# Module 5: Advanced Wallet and Identity Management with BRC-103 Integration

**Objective**: In this advanced module, students explore the design and implementation of modern BSV-based wallet and identity management using BRC-103 identity certificates, Type-42 key derivation, and atomic transaction patterns. This system combines standardized identity certificates, selective disclosure, secure spendable transaction output (STO) handling, and privacy-preserving P2P communication channels. Students will gain comprehensive understanding of modern identity certificate management, atomic operations with built-in accountability, and advanced privacy-preserving techniques.

**Prerequisites**: Understanding of atomic transactions, BEEF workflow, and basic BRC-103 identity certificate concepts.

#### **Lesson 1: BRC-103 Identity Certificate Fundamentals**

**Introduction to BRC-103 Identity Certificates**\
Modern BSV identity management uses BRC-103 identity certificates that provide verifiable identity with selective disclosure capabilities. Unlike traditional form-based approaches, BRC-103 certificates enable atomic transactions with built-in identity accountability while preserving privacy through selective disclosure.

**1.1 BRC-103 Certificate Structure and Standards**

**Standardized Certificate Format**\
BRC-103 certificates follow a standardized structure that ensures interoperability across BSV applications:

```typescript
// BRC-103 Certificate Structure
interface BRC103Certificate {
  version: '1.0',
  issuer: {
    publicKey: string,
    identity: string,
    signature: string
  },
  subject: {
    publicKey: string,
    claims: EncryptedClaims,
    selectiveDisclosureCapability: boolean
  },
  validity: {
    notBefore: number,
    notAfter: number
  },
  signature: string
}
```

**Identity Claims and Selective Disclosure**\
Modern identity certificates support selective disclosure of specific claims:

* **Core Identity Claims**: Name, age verification, location, professional credentials
* **Selective Disclosure Settings**: User-controlled privacy preferences for each claim
* **Encrypted Claims Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted using Type-42 key derivation
* **Verification Proofs**: Cryptographic proofs that enable verification without full disclosure

**Certificate Validation and Trust Chains**\
BRC-103 certificates support hierarchical trust through certificate chains, enabling enterprise and government identity verification while maintaining user privacy control.

***

#### **Lesson 2: Type-42 Key Derivation and Shared Key Universes**

**Type-42 Key Derivation for Private Communication**\
Type-42 key derivation enables shared key universes between parties, allowing for private communication and selective disclosure without external key exchange protocols.

**2.1 Type-42 Implementation Patterns**

**Shared Key Universe Generation**

```typescript
// Type-42 Key Derivation for Shared Secrets
async function deriveType42SharedKey(params: {
  myPrivateKey: PrivateKey,
  theirPublicKey: PublicKey,
  invoiceNumber: string,
  keyDerivationSalt?: string
}): Promise<SharedKey> {
  // Generate shared key universe for private communication
  // Enables encrypted data exchange in atomic transactions
  // Both parties can derive same key without key exchange
}
```

**Identity Certificate Key Management**

* **Certificate Private Keys**: Securely managed using Type-42 derivation patterns
* **Selective Disclosure Keys**: Separate keys for each disclosable claim
* **Communication Keys**: Shared key universes for private P2P communication
* **Application-Specific Keys**: Derived keys for specific application contexts

**2.2 Atomic Authentication Workflow**

**BRC-103 Certificate-Based Authentication**

```typescript
// Atomic authentication with identity verification
async function authenticateWithIdentity(params: {
  certificate: BRC103Certificate,
  selectiveDisclosure: string[],
  applicationContext: string
}): Promise<AuthenticationResult> {
  // Verify certificate authenticity
  // Apply selective disclosure preferences
  // Generate application-specific authentication token
  // Enable atomic operations with identity accountability
}
```

**Spendable Transaction Output (STO) Management with Identity**

* **Identity-Linked STOs**: Each STO associated with verified identity certificate
* **Selective Disclosure in Transactions**: Reveal only necessary identity fields
* **Atomic Operations**: STOs spent atomically with identity verification
* **Privacy-Preserving Accountability**: Full accountability without compromising privacy

***

#### **Lesson 3: Advanced STO Management with Identity Integration**

**Introduction to Identity-Aware STO Management**\
Modern STO management integrates BRC-103 identity certificates directly into spendable transaction outputs, enabling atomic operations with built-in accountability while maintaining privacy through selective disclosure.

**3.1 Identity-Based STO Security Protocols**

**Certificate-Based Authentication Levels**

```typescript
// Identity-aware STO authentication
interface STOSecurityLevel {
  value: number,
  identityRequirements: {
    certificateRequired: boolean,
    selectiveDisclosure: string[],
    mutualAuthentication?: boolean,
    additionalVerification?: 'biometric' | 'multisig' | 'time_lock'
  }
}
```

* **Microtransaction STOs**: Basic certificate verification with minimal disclosure
* **Standard STOs**: Selective disclosure of relevant identity claims
* **High-Value STOs**: Full certificate validation with additional verification factors
* **Enterprise STOs**: Multi-party certificate validation with audit trails

**3.2 STOs as Identity-Accountable Digital Envelopes**

**Modern STO Structure with Identity**

```typescript
// STO with embedded identity accountability
interface IdentityAccountableSTO {
  satoshis: number,
  lockingScript: Script,
  identityRequirements: {
    certificate: BRC103Certificate,
    selectiveDisclosure: SelectiveDisclosureSettings,
    verificationLevel: 'basic' | 'standard' | 'enhanced'
  },
  spendingConditions: AtomicSpendingConditions
}
```

**Atomic Transaction Flow with Identity**

* **Initiation**: User selects STO and initiates atomic operation with identity verification
* **Certificate Validation**: BRC-103 certificate verified and selective disclosure applied
* **Atomic Execution**: STO spent atomically with identity accountability embedded
* **BEEF Generation**: Transaction packaged in BEEF format with identity proofs included
* **Instant Finality**: SPV verification provides immediate confidence with identity verification

***

#### **Lesson 4: BRC-31 Authrite and Advanced P2P Identity Communication**

**BRC-31 Authrite for Mutual Authentication**\
Modern P2P communication uses BRC-31 Authrite protocol for mutual authentication between parties, enabling secure identity certificate exchange and verification without external identity providers.

**4.1 BRC-31 Authrite Implementation**

**Mutual Authentication Protocol**

```typescript
// BRC-31 Authrite mutual authentication
async function establishAuthriteConnection(params: {
  myCertificate: BRC103Certificate,
  theirPublicKey: PublicKey,
  selectiveDisclosure: SelectiveDisclosurePreferences
}): Promise<AuthriteConnection> {
  // Establish mutual authentication channel
  // Exchange identity certificates with selective disclosure
  // Create shared communication context
  // Enable ongoing authenticated communication
}
```

**Identity Certificate Exchange Patterns**

* **Initial Handshake**: Mutual certificate presentation with selective disclosure
* **Trust Verification**: Certificate chain validation and trust establishment
* **Ongoing Authentication**: Persistent authenticated communication channel
* **Privacy Preservation**: Minimal necessary identity disclosure throughout

**4.2 Advanced P2P Communication with Identity**

**Type-42 Enhanced Communication Channels**

```typescript
// Secure P2P communication with identity accountability
async function establishSecureChannel(params: {
  authriteConnection: AuthriteConnection,
  communicationPurpose: string,
  privacyLevel: 'minimal' | 'standard' | 'enhanced'
}): Promise<SecureCommunicationChannel> {
  // Create Type-42 shared key universe
  // Establish encrypted communication channel
  // Maintain identity accountability
  // Support atomic transaction coordination
}
```

**Identity-Aware Multicast and Service Discovery**

* **Authenticated Multicast Groups**: Identity-verified participants in group communications
* **Service Discovery with Identity**: Discover services with identity verification requirements
* **P2P Atomic Coordination**: Coordinate multi-party atomic transactions with identity
* **Privacy-Preserving Networks**: Maintain privacy while enabling identity accountability

***

#### **Lesson 5: Advanced Identity Certificate Management and Recovery**

**BRC-103 Certificate Lifecycle Management**\
Advanced identity certificate management includes secure backup, recovery, and lifecycle management while maintaining privacy and security through modern cryptographic techniques.

**5.1 Certificate Backup and Recovery Strategies**

**Distributed Certificate Storage**

```typescript
// Secure certificate backup with selective disclosure preservation
interface CertificateBackupStrategy {
  primaryCertificate: BRC103Certificate,
  backupLocations: SecureBackupLocation[],
  recoveryMechanisms: {
    socialRecovery: boolean,
    hardwareBackup: boolean,
    distributedShards: boolean
  },
  selectiveDisclosurePreservation: boolean
}
```

**Identity Certificate Recovery Protocols**

async function manageCertificateLifecycle(params: {
  currentCertificate: BRC103Certificate,
  updateRequirements: CertificateUpdateRequirements,
  continuityPreservation: boolean
}): Promise<UpdatedCertificate> {
  // Handle certificate renewal
  // Preserve ongoing relationships and selective disclosure settings
  // Maintain atomic transaction capability throughout transition
  // Ensure backward compatibility with existing applications
}
```

**Enterprise Identity Integration**

* **Certificate Authority Integration**: Support for enterprise certificate authorities
