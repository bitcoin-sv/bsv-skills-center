6. **Use Type-42 for privacy** - Implement shared key universes for sensitive data

### **Architecture Principles with Identity**
1. **Atomic operations with identity** over distributed coordination and separate identity systems
2. **Local verification** over external validation for both transactions and identity
3. **Token-based state with identity** over database state management and identity providers
4. **Standard interfaces** over custom protocols for both payments and identity
5. **Selective disclosure** over all-or-nothing identity revelation
6. **Built-in accountability** over external audit systems

## üîê Identity Integration Summary

Each live demo showcases different aspects of identity integration:

- **P2P MNEE**: Mutual authentication and selective disclosure in peer-to-peer payments
- **Truth Machine**: Professional credential verification for data attestation
- **Prescription Tokens**: Healthcare identity with privacy-preserving patient data
- **Natural Gas**: IoT device identity and operator credential verification
- **MetaNet Mobile**: Identity certificate management and cross-application portability

These patterns demonstrate how identity becomes a natural part of atomic operations rather than a separate system to coordinate with.
