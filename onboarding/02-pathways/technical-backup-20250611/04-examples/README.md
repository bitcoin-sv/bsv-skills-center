# Example Projects

Welcome to the Example Projects section of the BSV Technical Pathway. This module provides hands-on implementations that demonstrate how to build real-world applications using BSV's building blocks, smart contracts, and advanced concepts.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By completing this section, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ **Built a complete meter application** with overlay services
- ‚úÖ **Implemented a token system** with custom tokens
- ‚úÖ **Created a marketplace** with escrow and reputation systems
- ‚úÖ **Applied best practices** for production-ready applications
- ‚úÖ **Integrated multiple BSV components** into cohesive solutions
