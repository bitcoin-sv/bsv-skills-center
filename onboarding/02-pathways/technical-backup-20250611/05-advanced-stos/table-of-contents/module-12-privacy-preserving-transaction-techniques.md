# Module 12: Privacy-Preserving Transaction Techniques

Focusing on script-based privacy techniques, this module explores masked STOs, off-chain state management, and privacy-centric protocols for transaction security.

**Chapter 1: Scripted Privacy Layers for STOs**

1.1 **Masked STOs**

* Using cryptographic masks to reveal STO data conditionally.
* Scenarios for conditional STOs in business workflows.

1.2 **Dynamic Data Access and Privacy Layers**

* Setting up scripts to manage when and how data is accessible, integrating privacy-by-design.

**Chapter 2: Off-Chain State Management for Privacy**

2.1 **Off-Chain State Channels with Limited Disclosure**

* Creating privacy-preserving channels where minimal data is revealed.
* Ensuring only proof-based state changes are publicized.

2.2 **Selective Data Disclosure in Layered Channels**

* Setting conditions for what transaction data can be disclosed under various conditions.
