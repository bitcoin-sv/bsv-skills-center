# Module 3: SLAP Protocol (Service Lookup Availability Protocol) for Service Discovery

**Objective**: This module covers the SLAP (Service Lookup Availability Protocol), guiding students through the creation and implementation of SLAP tokens using BRC-48 for advertising lookup services. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of SLAP token architecture, its role in decentralized service discovery, and how it integrates within STOstore for secure and scalable service access.

***

#### **Lesson 1: SLAP Token Architecture with BRC-48**

The SLAP protocol uses tokens to enable services to advertise their availability within a decentralized environment. SLAP tokens operate similarly to SHIP tokens but are specifically structured to facilitate service discovery through metadata, enabling peers to discover, connect, and access services in overlay networks.

**1.1 Creating SLAP Tokens with BRC-48**

BRC-48 serves as a foundational structure for encoding data into tokens, ensuring that SLAP tokens are metadata-rich and retain transferability with security. By embedding service-specific metadata into SLAP tokens, nodes within the network can quickly discover available services without relying on a centralized directory.

**Key Features of SLAP Tokens Using BRC-48**:

* **Data-Driven Service Advertisement**: Metadata embedded within SLAP tokens includes information such as service type, provider ID, and status, which facilitates efficient advertisement and discovery.
* **Secure Ownership Transfer**: Each SLAP token is locked using a public key, allowing it to be transferred while retaining ownership authentication. The locking mechanism employs `P2PK` along with `OP_DROP` and `OP_2DROP` to secure the token, ensuring only the rightful owner can transfer or spend it.

**Example Script for SLAP Tokens (BRC-48)**

The structure of a SLAP token script follows BRC-48 standards, with metadata elements stored on the stack:

```plaintext
plaintextCopy code<metadata_field1> <metadata_field2> <service_type> OP_DROP OP_2DROP <public_key> OP_CHECKSIG
```

Here:

* `metadata_field1`, `metadata_field2`, and `service_type` represent key data attributes, like the service’s unique identifier, location, or status.
* `OP_DROP` and `OP_2DROP` clean up the stack after metadata storage, keeping only the essential `P2PK` lock and ensuring a secure ownership model.

This architecture enables SLAP tokens to facilitate both information storage and ownership transfer without complex transaction data structures, making SLAP highly suitable for decentralized service discovery.

#### **Lesson 2: SLAPTopicManager Implementation for Service Discovery**

**Objective**: In this lesson, students will learn how to manage SLAP tokens in the overlay environment using the `SLAPTopicManager` class. This class is responsible for identifying and validating tokens that meet SLAP-specific requirements, enabling secure service discovery within the STOstore.

***

**2.1 Structure and Role of SLAPTopicManager**

The `SLAPTopicManager` class provides the logic for managing SLAP tokens within STOstore, facilitating service advertisement and discovery. This class is designed to validate tokens based on SLAP requirements, ensuring they match specified topics or service parameters before they are added to the network’s lookup registry.

**Core Methods in SLAPTopicManager**:

1. **identifyAdmissibleOutputs**: This method is central to SLAP’s discovery capabilities, allowing nodes to filter and identify SLAP tokens based on metadata and protocol requirements.
   * **Inputs**: Accepts metadata fields and previous UTXO references, validating them against SLAP protocol rules.
   * **Outputs**: Returns only tokens that meet SLAP requirements, marking them as admissible for network-based service discovery.
2. **getMetaData**: Provides metadata for the SLAP topic being managed, such as name, description, and supported services, allowing clients to understand and retrieve relevant tokens for service advertisement.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeexport class SLAPTopicManager implements TopicManager {
    async identifyAdmissibleOutputs(metadataFields: Buffer[], previousUTXOs: Buffer[]): Promise<AdmittanceInstructions> {
        // SLAP-specific logic to validate tokens based on service metadata and past UTXOs
    }
    
    async getMetaData(): Promise<{ name: string; shortDescription: string; iconURL?: string; }> {
        return { name: "SLAP Topic Manager", shortDescription: "Manages SLAP tokens for service availability." };
    }
}
```

With this setup, the SLAPTopicManager enables efficient token validation and management, allowing only valid SLAP tokens to be added to the STOstore and accessed for peer discovery.

**2.2 Filtering and Identifying SLAP Tokens**

To maintain a clean and reliable discovery process, `SLAPTopicManager` filters tokens based on specific criteria:

* **Protocol Compliance**: Checks that SLAP tokens conform to BRC-48 specifications and that metadata aligns with SLAP’s protocol-specific fields.
* **Signature and Ownership Verification**: Verifies the `P2PK` lock and the associated public key, ensuring the token’s ownership and integrity.
* **Topic Relevance**: Validates that each token advertises relevant service information, confirming the service type or location aligns with the specified SLAP topic.

These validations create a robust system for service advertisement, helping nodes discover peers based on pre-established criteria without needing centralized infrastructure.

***

#### **Lesson 3: SLAP Lookup Service for Decentralized Service Access**

**Objective**: Learn how the `SLAPLookupService` enables decentralized access to services by managing SLAP tokens within STOstore, offering a practical tool for querying, processing, and validating tokens for service discovery in real-time.

***

**3.1 Building SLAPLookupService for Decentralized Discovery**

The `SLAPLookupService` class provides a critical link between service advertisement and service discovery, facilitating decentralized, topic-based access to services within the overlay network.

**Key Features of SLAPLookupService**:

* **Efficient Service Queries**: The service accepts queries based on metadata fields, allowing nodes to find relevant SLAP tokens and associated services based on specific needs.
* **Real-Time Validation**: Validates each SLAP token’s metadata, ensuring only authorized and accurate service advertisements are accessible.
* **De-centralized Query Management**: As a decentralized solution, SLAPLookupService does not rely on a single node or server, allowing peer nodes to access services directly based on token metadata.

**SLAPLookupService Workflow**

1. **Adding Outputs**: When a SLAP token is created, the `outputAdded` method validates its metadata and service fields, adding it to STOstore if compliant.
2. **Querying for Services**: Nodes query SLAPLookupService to discover services by specifying metadata fields or topics, receiving references to matching SLAP tokens.
3. **Token Validation**: SLAP tokens retrieved during queries are verified to ensure integrity and ownership, providing authenticated service discovery.

**Code Sample**:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeexport class SLAPLookupService implements LookupService {
    constructor(public storage: SLAPStorage) {}

    async outputAdded(txid: string, outputIndex: number, service: string): Promise<void> {
        // Processes and validates SLAP token before adding to SLAP storage
    }

    async lookup(query: { service: string }): Promise<UTXOReference[]> {
        // Finds matching SLAP tokens in storage for decentralized discovery
        return await this.storage.findRecord(query);
    }
}
```

In this setup, `SLAPLookupService` provides an adaptable method for peer nodes to discover available services, creating an efficient, secure discovery mechanism within the decentralized overlay environment.

***

#### **Summary of Module 3**

In this module, we covered the SLAP protocol and its role in decentralized service discovery. By leveraging BRC-48 to create metadata-rich SLAP tokens and integrating them with STOstore, we ensured that nodes can advertise and discover services seamlessly. Using `SLAPTopicManager` and `SLAPLookupService`, students learned to implement, query, and manage SLAP tokens, setting the foundation for a scalable, decentralized service discovery solution in the overlay network.
