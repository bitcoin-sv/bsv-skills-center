# Module 11: Advanced SPV Techniques for Distributed Applications

This module covers advanced applications of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), exploring how SPV adapts to distributed systems, multi-path verifications, and high-frequency transaction environments.

**Chapter 1: Deep Dive into Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)**

1.1 **SPV Beyond Lightweight Clients**

* In-depth look at SPV for distributed nodes and non-wallet use cases.
* How overlay nodes and STOstore services leverage SPV for verification.

1.2 **Implementation in Overlay Nodes and Verification Pathways**

* Applying SPV specifically for overlays, ensuring consistent verification with minimum data transmission.

**Chapter 2: Multi-Path SPV and Enhanced Verification**

2.1 **Multi-Path SPV**

* Using multiple data sources to verify transactions in distributed settings.
* Benefits for overlay nodes and high-availability applications.

2.2 **Handling Forks and Network Changes with SPV**

* Adjusting SPV to handle network disruptions, forks, or reorganization.

**Chapter 3: SPV in High-Frequency Transaction Systems**

3.1 **SPV with Payment Channels and Data-Rich Transactions**

* Integrating SPV into payment channels for rapid transaction verification.
* Handling frequent data-driven STO transactions.

3.2 **Optimizing SPV for IoT and Streaming Payments**

* Customizing SPV workflows for low-latency environments, particularly IoT and micro-payments.
