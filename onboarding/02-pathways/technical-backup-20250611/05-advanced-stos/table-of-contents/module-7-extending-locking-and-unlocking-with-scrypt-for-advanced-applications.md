# Module 7: Extending Locking and Unlocking with sCrypt for Advanced Applications

This module introduces sCrypt, a high-level, compiled language that dramatically expands the capabilities of Bitcoin Script for complex, flexible transactions. With sCrypt, developers can create advanced locking and unlocking scripts beyond what’s feasible with native Bitcoin opcodes alone. By compiling down to Bitcoin Script, sCrypt makes it easier to design sophisticated applications, from micropayments to decentralized assets, with accessible syntax and broader flexibility.

#### Chapter 1: Introduction to sCrypt

**1.1 What is sCrypt?**

sCrypt is a high-level, Turing-complete language for Bitcoin Script, making it possible to implement intricate conditional transactions, multi-signature agreements, and data-integrated transactions in a more readable and developer-friendly format. Designed to compile directly to Bitcoin’s native script, sCrypt simplifies writing complex scripts without requiring developers to master Bitcoin’s raw opcodes.

**1.2 Advantages of sCrypt for Complex Scripts**

* **Simplified Syntax**: sCrypt’s syntax is more approachable than raw Bitcoin Script, making complex logic easier to follow and troubleshoot.
* **Expansive Capabilities**: As a compiled language, sCrypt can represent complex business logic, such as conditional access, state channels, and data-based permissions.
* **Enhanced Modularity**: sCrypt enables developers to write reusable and modular code blocks, making it easier to adapt scripts for new use cases without starting from scratch.

#### Chapter 2: sCrypt Fundamentals – Key Concepts

**2.1 Compilation to Bitcoin Script**

When sCrypt code is compiled, it generates equivalent Bitcoin Script. This compilation makes the sCrypt code executable within the Bitcoin SV environment while maintaining compatibility with the Bitcoin VM.

**Example of Basic sCrypt Script:**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codecontract SimpleLock {
    public function unlock(int x) {
        require(x == 42);
    }
}
```

In this example, the function `unlock` requires an input of `42` to unlock the transaction, showcasing a straightforward lock condition with sCrypt.

**2.2 Data Structures and Functions in sCrypt**

* **Custom Data Structures**: sCrypt supports custom structures like arrays, enabling richer transaction metadata.
* **Functions and Conditions**: sCrypt’s functional design enables layered conditions within scripts. For example, multi-signature verification and conditional statements can be incorporated seamlessly.

#### Chapter 3: Advanced Locking and Unlocking with sCrypt

**3.1 Using sCrypt to Enhance LockScripts**

sCrypt allows you to set complex conditions within a lockScript that would be challenging to implement directly with Bitcoin Script. Business rules can be encoded in a readable format, opening the door for intricate permissions and conditional data access.

**Example: Multi-signature Agreement in sCrypt**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codecontract MultiSig {
    PubKey key1;
    PubKey key2;
    PubKey key3;

    public function unlock(Sig sig1, Sig sig2) {
        require(checkSig(sig1, key1) && checkSig(sig2, key2) || 
                checkSig(sig1, key2) && checkSig(sig2, key3) ||
                checkSig(sig1, key1) && checkSig(sig2, key3));
    }
}
```

In this example, the transaction requires two out of three possible signatures to unlock, a common multi-signature use case in business applications.

**3.2 Time-Locked Scripts**

sCrypt can simplify time-locked transactions, allowing you to set block height or timestamp conditions for unlocking. This is beneficial for use cases like vesting schedules or delayed payments.

**Example: Time-Locked Script in sCrypt**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codecontract TimeLock {
    int lockTime;

    public function unlock() {
        require(Tx.time >= lockTime);
    }
}
```

Here, the `unlock` function will only execute if the current block’s timestamp meets the specified `lockTime`, making the transaction spendable only after that point.

***

#### Chapter 4: Conditional Access and Data-Driven Transactions

**4.1 Implementing Data Validation with sCrypt**

Data-driven transactions unlock specific conditions based on stored data. sCrypt enables these complex workflows where transactions can conditionally execute based on external inputs or proofs.

**Example: Hash-Based Data Access**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codecontract DataAccess {
    Sha256 hash;

    public function unlock(bytes data) {
        require(hash256(data) == hash);
    }
}
```

This script checks whether the hash of the provided data matches the pre-stored hash, making it useful for applications needing data verification before unlocking funds.

**4.2 Conditional Scripts for Audit and Control**

sCrypt can set conditions for audit trails or create logic that mandates data verification steps before funds can be accessed. This enables workflows like escrow services, where funds are released upon meeting certain conditions.

***

#### Chapter 5: Dynamic Payment Channels and Micropayment Structures

**5.1 Payment Channels Using sCrypt**

For applications requiring continuous or incremental payments, sCrypt’s flexibility enables efficient payment channel setups where small transactions can occur off-chain and only periodically settle on-chain.

**Example: State Channel with sCrypt**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codecontract StateChannel {
    int balance;

    public function updateBalance(int newBalance, Sig sig1, PubKey key1, Sig sig2, PubKey key2) {
        require(checkSig(sig1, key1) && checkSig(sig2, key2));
        balance = newBalance;
    }
}
```

This script enables incremental updates to the balance with multi-signature verification, enabling state channels that facilitate micropayments for services like streaming or IoT data exchange.

**5.2 Micropayments for Data Access**

With sCrypt, businesses can define specific scripts for micropayments, allowing customers to pay small amounts to access individual files, streams, or API endpoints.

***

#### Chapter 6: Extending Business Logic with sCrypt Modules and Templates

**6.1 Reusability and Modularity in sCrypt**

Scripts can be designed as modular units, enabling businesses to reuse components for different transactions. This cuts down on redundant code and allows for easier updates to logic as business needs evolve.

**Example: sCrypt Function Module for Access Control**

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelibrary AccessControl {
    function isAuthorized(PubKey key, Sig sig, PubKey[] authorizedKeys) {
        bool authorized = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < authorizedKeys.length; i++) {
            if (checkSig(sig, authorizedKeys[i])) {
                authorized = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        require(authorized);
    }
}
```

By creating a reusable function, `isAuthorized`, businesses can simplify the development of complex access-controlled transactions, ensuring consistency across multiple applications.

**6.2 Templates for Multi-Use Contracts**

Businesses can develop templates for common use cases like subscription payments, token issuance, or asset-backed securities, reducing development time and allowing rapid deployment.
