# Lesson 5: Advanced Key Management and Recovery Mechanisms

Lesson 5 covers decentralized key management and recovery strategies, leveraging the wallet's form-based identity module to create a backup and recovery process without permanent key storage. Through dynamic key regeneration and collaboration with application service layers, users maintain secure access to their spendable transaction outputs (STOs) in cases of device loss or failure.

#### **Backup and Recovery with Non-Persistent Keys**

This wallet's decentralized key management model allows users to re-authenticate and restore STOs without storing sensitive key information permanently. The approach is both secure and flexible, relying on the form-based identity structure to reconstruct keys dynamically when needed.

***

#### **5.1 Key Regeneration for Secure Backup**

The system’s key regeneration scheme ensures that master keys and associated STOs can be retrieved securely, even without prior key storage.

**App-Based Key Storage for Re-Authentication**

Each application authenticating with the wallet/identity module uses a unique key generation scheme. When a master key is derived, it forms the root for further key creation, providing secure session management for STOs:

1. **Key Generation Scheme Storage**:
   * Only the key derivation scheme (e.g., “fields 3.1, 3.2”) is stored, along with the application name.
   * This allows the re-creation of the master key by supplying correct answers to the form fields, making persistent key storage unnecessary.
2. **Dynamic Key Generation and Authentication**:
   * Applications derive a fresh key pair for each STO, based on the master key.
   * STOs are trackable by associating them with the relevant application and master key, allowing for secure storage and retrieval.

**Code Example: Key Regeneration**

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Example of dynamically regenerating the master key using stored key scheme

const crypto = require("crypto");

class KeyManager {
  constructor(formResponses) {
    this.formResponses = formResponses;  // User's answers for key regeneration
  }

  /**
   * Generates a master key using selected form fields
   * @param {Array} fields - Selected fields from the form schema (e.g., ["3.1", "3.2"])
   * @returns {Buffer} Master key hash
   */
  generateMasterKey(fields) {
    const selectedAnswers = fields.map(field => this.formResponses[field]);
    const concatenatedHashes = selectedAnswers
      .map(answer => crypto.createHash("sha256").update(answer).digest())
      .join("");
    return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(concatenatedHashes).digest();
  }
}

// Usage
const formResponses = { "3.1": "answer1", "3.2": "answer2" };
const keyManager = new KeyManager(formResponses);

const masterKey = keyManager.generateMasterKey(["3.1", "3.2"]);
console.log("Generated Master Key:", masterKey.toString("hex"));
```

**Configurable STO Backup Options**

Authenticated applications can enable STO backup and export options, allowing users to secure STO data while retaining minimal authentication steps.

1. **Backup Options**:
   * STO data can be backed up to secure, external storage solutions if desired.
   * This ensures STO continuity, even in cases of device failure, while safeguarding identity data.
2. **Recovery Protocols**:
   * Users can securely retrieve STOs through key regeneration steps.
   * By recreating the key and querying associated applications, users restore access to STOs, protecting assets in the event of device loss.

***

#### **5.2 Collaborative Recovery with Applications**

If a device is lost or replaced, users need a way to restore their STOs. The key generation scheme and application collaboration allow users to recreate master keys and restore the STOstore for specific applications.

**Example: App-Based STOstore Recovery**

Imagine an app ("App X") authenticated with the wallet's identity module. For each STO created within App X, the wallet generates a fresh key pair derived from the master key. This creates a dynamic, trackable key structure for each STO.

1. **Sharing Key Scheme with App X**:
   * The wallet shares key derivation flags (e.g., fields “3.1”, “3.2”) with App X.
   * App X inputs an additional unique value for each STO, combining this value with the key flags to ensure further security.
2. **Backup of Non-Sensitive Data**:
   * Users back up the form fields and schema labels (e.g., question and field numbers) independently.
   * Secret answers remain private, while field labels are stored without risk.
3. **Querying App X to Restore STOs**:
   * When a user re-authenticates with App X, they query for STOs generated under a specific master key.
   * App X provides the necessary STO details to restore the user’s STOstore, allowing access to all STOs generated under the master key without storing the master key itself.

**Code Example: Querying App X for STOs**

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Sample function for querying STOs from an authenticated app

class AppXAPI {
  constructor(userId, masterKey) {
    this.userId = userId;
    this.masterKey = masterKey;
  }

  /**
   * Queries App X for STOs associated with the user's master key
   * @returns {Array} Array of STOs generated under the master key
   */
  async querySTOs() {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.appx.com/stos", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.masterKey}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ userId: this.userId })
    });
    const stoData = await response.json();
    return stoData.stos;  // Array of STO objects
  }
}

// Usage
const appXAPI = new AppXAPI("user123", masterKey);
appXAPI.querySTOs().then(stos => console.log("Recovered STOs:", stos));
```

#### **Advantages of Decentralized Key Management and Recovery**

1. **Security and Privacy**:
   * Sensitive information like answers and STO keys are not stored, enhancing privacy.
   * Keys are generated only as needed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
2. **Flexibility and Accessibility**:
   * Users maintain control of their STOs across multiple applications, recovering them dynamically without long-term data storage.
   * Flexible recovery protocols enable users to access their STOstore in case of device loss or app migration.
3. **Application Collaboration**:
   * Each application assists in managing STOs without needing access to master keys, offering users seamless backup and recovery experiences.
   * Shared STO recovery protocols ensure continuity and ease of access.

#### **Summary**

Lesson 5 presents a decentralized approach to key management and recovery, focusing on app-based key generation schemes and collaborative STO restoration. Through dynamic key regeneration and STO retrieval via application queries, users maintain secure and seamless access to their assets without storing sensitive information. This layered approach enhances security, flexibility, and resilience in decentralized wallet management.
