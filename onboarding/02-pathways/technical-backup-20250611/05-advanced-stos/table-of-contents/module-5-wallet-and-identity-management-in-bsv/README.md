# Module 5: Wallet and Identity Management in BSV

**Objective**: In this module, students explore the design and implementation of a theoretical BSV-based wallet and identity management service that uses identity-based key generation. This system combines form-based identity data, secure transaction handling, and flexible, privacy-preserving P2P communication channels. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of secure key management, dynamic authentication, and identity-backed STO handling.

#### **Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Identity-Based Key Management in BSV**

**Introduction to Identity-Based Key Management**\
This approach combines identity elements and standardized data structures with cryptographic hashing, allowing identity-based authentication without storing sensitive information. Rather than a typical wallet with stored private keys, this design uses form-based identity responses, standardized to create unique, session-specific keys dynamically.

**1.1 Identity Schema and Data Standards**

**Standardized Identity Data**\
The wallet captures identity elements from globally recognized documents, such as passports, following the ICAO Logical Data Structure (LDS1) standard, to ensure consistency and interoperability.

* **Passport Data Fields**: Document type, name, passport number, nationality, date of birth, sex, and expiration date.
* **Additional Identity Documents**: Birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and other regionally defined documents follow their specific standardized fields.
* **Secret Questions**: Custom secret questions offer added layers of verification, dynamically incorporated into the identity schema.

**Double SHA-256 Hashing for Security**\
To secure all identity responses, this model applies a double SHA-256 hash to every form field, which prevents direct recovery of the input data and supports secure, non-persistent key generation.

#### **Lesson 2: Master Key Generation and Authentication for Decentralized Services**

**Dynamic Key Generation Scheme**\
Master keys in this system are not stored permanently but are generated on-demand, leveraging hashed identity fields and custom question responses.

**2.1 Key Derivation and Storage Process**

**Random Field Selection and Hash Matching**

* When authenticating an application, a random selection of form fields and secret questions is used.
* Each answer is hashed individually and checked against stored double hashes, ensuring only the correct inputs generate the intended key.
* A master key is then created by concatenating these individual hashes and applying SHA-256 once more.

**Non-Persistent Key Scheme**

* Only the scheme (e.g., “fields 1.2, 3.4, 3.6”) is stored, not the key itself, along with the name of the authenticated application.
* This non-persistent design enhances security by removing long-term storage of sensitive cryptographic data.

**2.2 Authentication Workflow for Applications**

**Application Authentication and STO Export**

* When a user authenticates with an application, the dynamic key allows for controlled access to STOs associated with that session.
* The STOstore keeps track of STOs tied to each session key, supporting a flexible, adaptable approach to managing spendable transaction outputs.

***

#### **Lesson 3: STO Management and Security Protocols**

**Introduction to STO Management in STOstore**\
The wallet’s local STO store manages spendable transaction outputs (STOs) with configurable security levels based on transaction value, integrating dynamic authentication to enable scalable, secure transactions.

**3.1 Flexible Security Protocols for STOs**

**Value-Based Authentication Levels**

* **Low-Value Transactions**: Quick, simple authentication; ideal for microtransactions.
* **Mid-Value Transactions**: Requires swipe patterns or single secret questions.
* **High-Value Transactions**: Demands multifactor authentication, such as multiple secret answers or a biometric factor.

**3.2 STOs as Digital Envelopes and Registered Mail Bags**

**STOs as Envelopes in Secure Transactions**

* STOs represent digital envelopes, with the secure key derived from the identity schema used to “open” the envelope and approve the transaction.
* The STOstore acts as a tamper-proof registry for storing STOs, allowing users to verify the integrity of their assets securely.

**Transaction Flow**

* **Initiation**: The user selects an STO and initiates the spend.
* **Authentication**: Depending on the STO’s value, the key regeneration scheme is referenced, and the user provides answers or performs required gestures.
* **Validation and Completion**: Once validated, the STO is unlocked, spent, and the transaction is added to the blockchain with full integrity checks.

#### **Lesson 4: Peer-to-Peer Communication and ECDHA in Decentralized Wallets**

**Using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Authentication (ECDHA) for P2P Channels**\
The wallet enables secure P2P communications by generating shared secrets between contacts using ECDHA, establishing private channels that support Bitcoin Certified IPv6 addressing for multicast groups and service discovery.

**4.1 Creating Shared Secrets for P2P Channels**

**ECDHA Shared Secrets**\
ECDHA allows two users to generate a shared secret for secure communication:

* Each party’s public key is used to compute the shared secret.
* This shared secret is unique to each user pair, ensuring message confidentiality.

**Bitcoin Certified IPv6 Address Mapping**

* Contacts are associated with Bitcoin Certified IPv6 addresses, linking identities with IP mappings for efficient, private communication.
* Users can manage P2P communication and participate in multicast groups securely, using IPv6 mappings to determine which addresses to send and receive from.

**4.2 Practical Applications in P2P and Serverless Architectures**

**Multicast Groups and Decentralized Content Delivery**\
Using ECDHA, users can join multicast groups with secure authentication, supporting P2P and serverless architectures:

* **P2P File Sharing**: UHRP-enhanced data retrieval enables users to share files directly with authenticated peers.
* **Distributed Content Networks**: Users can set up serverless, P2P content delivery systems, with each node acting as a secure data host for the group.

***

#### **Lesson 5: Advanced Key Management and Recovery Mechanisms**

**Backup and Recovery with Non-Persistent Keys**\
This wallet introduces a decentralized approach to backing up STOs and supporting re-authentication without permanently storing keys, reducing risks of data exposure or misuse.

**5.1 Key Regeneration for Secure Backup**

**App-Based Key Storage**\
Each application maintains its unique key generation scheme, allowing users to regenerate keys without storing sensitive information permanently. This setup supports secure backup and recovery by:

* Saving only the scheme, not the actual key.
* Allowing users to re-authenticate and re-access STOs by recreating the key as needed.

**Configurable STO Backup Options**\
Authenticated applications can enable STO export or backup features, securely offloading STO data while keeping authentication steps lightweight:

* **Backup Options**: Export of STOs to secure, external storage.
* **Recovery Protocols**: Securely retrieve STOs through key regeneration steps, protecting user assets even in the event of device loss.

#### **Summary of Module 7**

In Module 7, students have learned to design and manage a BSV wallet and identity service that integrates form-based identity schemas, secure STO handling, and dynamic key management. Through practical applications, they’ve explored non-persistent key generation, value-based STO authentication, ECDHA-based P2P channels, and decentralized data management. This advanced module equips students with the technical foundations needed to architect secure, privacy-preserving wallets that can adapt to various transaction needs and decentralized applications.
