# Lesson 1: Fundamentals of Identity-Based Key Management in BSV

**Introduction to Identity-Based Key Management**

In traditional BSV wallets, private keys are stored directly, which poses a risk if the keys are compromised. This module introduces an alternative approach: an identity-based key management model that dynamically generates session-specific keys using hashed identity elements. This model avoids permanently storing private keys, instead using identity data and custom secret questions as secure authentication materials. By generating keys on-demand through selective field hashing, the system enables secure, non-persistent key creation and enhanced privacy.

This identity-first wallet uses structured form data from official documents (e.g., passports, birth certificates, driver’s licenses) and user-defined secret questions to authenticate users. With double-hashed responses stored securely, the system relies on intermediate hashes for key creation, making it robust against data exposure. This approach also introduces users to flexible, identity-based key generation techniques enabled by the BSV blockchain infrastructure.

#### **1.1 Identity Schema and Data Standards**

**Standardized Identity Data**

The identity-based wallet integrates structured data from widely recognized identity documents, aligning with international standards to ensure cross-border applicability and enhanced security.

**Key Identity Data Sources**

1. **Passport Data (ICAO LDS1 Standard)**
   * The International Civil Aviation Organization’s Logical Data Structure (LDS1) standard outlines the fields for machine-readable passports, facilitating interoperability with global security systems.
   * **Core Data Fields**:
     * **Document Type**: The document classification code (e.g., “P” for passport).
     * **Name**: Full name of the passport holder, standardized per LDS1.
     * **Passport Number**: Unique identifier assigned by the issuing country.
     * **Nationality**: Country code representing the holder’s nationality.
     * **Date of Birth**: Holder’s birth date in a standard format.
     * **Sex**: Holder’s gender.
     * **Expiration Date**: Date the passport expires.
2. **Additional Identity Documents**
   * The wallet includes support for other documents (e.g., birth certificates, driver’s licenses), which follow regional standards for data consistency and relevance.
   * **Example Fields**:
     * **Birth Certificate**: Name, date of birth, place of birth, and parent names.
     * **Driver’s License**: License number, issuing state, expiration date, and address.
3. **Secret Questions**
   * Users add security by selecting from custom secret questions or creating their own. These answers are securely stored and hashed, forming part of the dynamic identity schema.
   * This schema is adaptable, automatically incorporating new entries as the user updates their secret questions, expanding the potential identity fields for verification.

**Schema Design and Customization**

* The structured data across identity sources is organized into a modular schema stored as double hashes. This schema can easily expand to accommodate new document types or secret questions as needed.

#### **Double SHA-256 Hashing for Security**

Each field’s response is processed through double SHA-256 hashing to ensure security and privacy. This dual-layer hashing protects against the reverse-engineering of stored values while allowing for secure, on-demand key generation using an intermediate hash.

1. **Initial Hashing (Intermediate Hash)**: Each response is hashed once, generating an intermediate hash that serves as a unique identifier for the answer. This intermediate hash is essential to the key generation process.
2. **Double Hashing**: The intermediate hash is hashed again, creating a double-hash value that is stored in the wallet. This double hash is highly secure, as it’s challenging to reverse without the original input.

**Benefits of Using Double and Intermediate Hashes**

* **Security and Privacy**: Only double hashes are stored, while the intermediate hash remains hidden, preventing direct access to the original data.
* **On-Demand Key Generation**: The intermediate hash allows session-based key generation, ensuring that users can verify responses against stored double hashes without storing sensitive information directly.
* **Dynamic Key Derivation**: By creating keys on demand using intermediate hashes, this approach minimizes security risks, supporting secure, non-persistent session keys.

#### **Using Intermediate Hashes in Key Generation**

When a user needs to generate a master key for authentication, a selection of fields is chosen based on the application’s security requirements. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Field Selection**: Random fields, including secret questions, are selected as part of the key generation scheme for each application.
2. **User Response Verification**: The user provides responses to the selected fields, which are then hashed.
3. **Verification Against Stored Double Hashes**: Each hashed response is verified against its stored double hash to ensure accuracy. Once verified, the intermediate hash of each field is isolated.
4. **Key Creation Using Intermediate Hashes**: The master key is generated by hashing the concatenation of the verified intermediate hashes. This key is session-specific and is never stored directly, ensuring security and privacy.

Only the field selection scheme (e.g., “fields 1.2, 3.4, 3.6, 7.1, 7.3”) is stored along with the application’s name. This allows users to regenerate the master key on-demand by providing the necessary inputs.

#### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Dynamic Identity Schema**: The wallet captures and securely manages data from multiple identity sources and secret questions, creating a robust, flexible identity schema.
2. **Intermediate Hashes for Secure Key Creation**: Using intermediate hashes for key generation, the wallet creates session-specific keys, enabling secure authentication while retaining user privacy.
3. **Enhanced Security via Double Hashing**: The wallet’s double hashing approach minimizes exposure risk by preventing access to sensitive data, even if storage is compromised.
