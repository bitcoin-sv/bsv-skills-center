# UTXO-Base vs Account-Based Systems

A UTXO-based system (Unspent Transaction Output) and an account-based system are two different methods of tracking ownership and transactions in blockchain networks.

## Key Differences

**Granularity**

* UTXO-based transactions deal with discrete units (UTXOs), making it easier to handle microtransactions and avoid partial updates.
* Account-based transactions directly update account balances, simplifying some aspects of transaction processing but making microtransactions impossible in practice.

**State Management**

* UTXO-based state is a set of unspent transaction outputs, which can be verified independently.
* Account-based state is a set of account balances, requiring more complex synchronization and validation.

**Double-Spending**

* UTXO-based double-spending is prevented by tracking the state of each UTXO.
* Account-based double-spending is prevented by ensuring the system balances out after every transaction.&#x20;
