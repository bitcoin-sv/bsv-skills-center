# The History of BSV Blockchain

* 2008: Bitcoin White Paper
  * On October 31, 2008
  * Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"​​. The white paper described a decentralized digital currency that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution, solving the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.&#x20;
* 2009: Bitcoin Network Launch:
  * January 3, 2009
  * The Bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first Bitcoin software and the mining of the genesis block (Block 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. The first block included a message in its coinbase parameter: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," indicating the economic context that influenced Bitcoin's creation.&#x20;
* 2009: First Bitcoin Transaction:
  * January 12, 2009
  * Satoshi sent 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney, marking the first-ever Bitcoin transaction.&#x20;
* 2010: Bitcoin's First Real-World Transaction:
  * On May 22, 2010
  * known as Bitcoin Pizza Day, Laszlo Hanyecz made the first real-world transaction using Bitcoin, buying two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. This event demonstrated Bitcoin's potential as a medium of exchange and began its journey toward real-world use. 2010: Bitcoin Market and Value:
* In July 2010
  * The first public Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, was launched. By the end of 2010, Bitcoin's value began to gain attention, trading at around $0.30 per bitcoin.&#x20;
* 2011: Early Adoption and Silk Road:
  * February 2011
  * Bitcoin reached parity with the US dollar, trading at $1 per bitcoin. The same year, Bitcoin gained notoriety as the primary currency on the Silk Road, an online black market.
* 2012: Increased Recognition:
  * Bitcoin saw increased adoption and recognition, with businesses beginning to accept it as a form of payment.&#x20;
  * In September 2012, the Bitcoin Foundation was established to promote and develop Bitcoin.&#x20;
* 2013: Price Surge and Volatility:
  * Bitcoin's price experienced significant volatility, reaching a high of over $1,000 in late 2013.&#x20;
  * This period also saw increased regulatory scrutiny and growing interest from mainstream media.&#x20;
* 2014: Mt. Gox Collapse:
  * February 2014
  * Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, filed for bankruptcy after losing approximately 850,000 bitcoins due to theft.&#x20;
  * This event highlighted the need for better security and regulatory oversight in the Bitcoin ecosystem.&#x20;
* 2015-2017: Growth and Scaling Debates:
  * Bitcoin's adoption continued to grow, but so did debates over its scalability.&#x20;
  * The Bitcoin community faced challenges in addressing transaction speeds and network capacity.&#x20;
* 2017: SegWit and Forks:
  * August 2017
  * Bitcoin underwent a significant upgrade with the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) to address scalability issues.&#x20;
  * Disagreements within the community led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a fork of Bitcoin that aimed to increase transaction capacity by enlarging the block size.&#x20;
* 2018-Present: Bitcoin SV and Continued Development:
  * In 2018, further disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community led to another fork, resulting in Bitcoin SV (BSV), which is widely accepted as the true continuation of the original Bitcoin protocol due to its adherence to the original design, focusing on scalability and stability.&#x20;
  * BSV adheres to the original Bitcoin protocol and enables massive scaling to handle large volumes of transactions and data​​.
