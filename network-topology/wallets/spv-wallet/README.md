## Benefits

### **Secure**

{% hint style="success" %}
Transactions are verified instantly using SPV, network approval is obtained within 5 seconds, and proof of inclusion obtained as soon as they're mined.

The non-custodial model allows private keys to remain broadly distributed, reducing the incentive to attack, protecting user funds.
{% endhint %}

### **Scalable**

{% hint style="success" %}
Address based payments require recipients to filter through all transactions to find relevant ones. This requires global indexing which has proven difficult to scale.

The SPV approach circumvents this entirely by enabling counterparties to communicate directly with no external factors limiting scalability.
{% endhint %}

### **Cost Savings**

{% hint style="success" %}
Operational cost is proportional to use rather than to overall network transaction volume. This is achieved by keeping block headers, ignoring external transactions, and using Merkle proofs.

In addition, the BSV Association will actively support the open source software through the upcoming network topology shift towards Overlay Networks and Teranode. This will externalize maintenance costs for businesses using the open source software.
{% endhint %}

### **Legal**

{% hint style="success" %}
With direct transmission between counterparties, you get SSL certificates, IP addresses, PKI signatures, and payment metadata on your terms. Regulatory compliance is easy when considering KYC, AML, or Travel Rule requirements, all without compromising user privacy
{% endhint %}

***

### **"LiteClient" has been replaced by "SPV Wallet"**

{% hint style="info" %}
The term was often misunderstood since there are multiple components to a complete system and it wasn't clear whether one component was the LiteClient or whether the whole system was. There are multiple clients and servers in this collection of tools which forms the SPV Wallet.
{% endhint %}
