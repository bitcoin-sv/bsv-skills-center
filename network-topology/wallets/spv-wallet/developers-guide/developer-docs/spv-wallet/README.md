### Important Concepts

#### BUMP, BEEF and SPV

SPV Wallet work with BUMP Merkle Proof format, which is a way to prove that transaction is included in the block.

After broadcasting or receiving a transaction, SPV Wallet will query Arc API (or wait for a callback) to get BUMP for the transaction. Having BUMP on any level of ancestry for all inputs of the transaction, allows us to send it to the network.

By having this information we can easily verify all merkle proofs which is a part of SPV protocol.

To verify merkleroots we need to have a block headers service running. More about BUMP you can read [here](https://brc.dev/74).
