## Overview

SPV Wallet Admin console is an admin panel that allows for viewing (and in some parts integrating with) SPV Wallet data.

## Usage

### Locally

1. Clone [spv-wallet-admin](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/spv-wallet-admin)

2. Create an `env-config.json` file in root of the project and put **SPV Wallet URL** (localhost if you run locally):

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3003/v1",
}
```

If localhost doesn't work, try putting `http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1` as the url.

1. Run SPV Wallet Admin

```bash
yarn        # to install
yarn dev    # to run
```

4. Enter the url in the browser (usually localhost:3000) and log in with your xPriv.

### Docker-compose

## What it offers

1. Admin Dashboard
    * You can quickly jump to useful links from here (like xpubs, transactions, destinations, paymails)
    * Viewing transactions and UTXOS (not implemented yet)
2. Registering an xPub
    * From xPriv
    * Or just by pasting an xPub key
    * Added xPubs are shown in XPubs list
3. Access Keys
    * View access key data
    * Revoke access key (not working - probably a frontend problem)
4. Destinations
    * Viewing addresses and locking scripts of destinations
    * Seems to be creating a new destination every minute
5. Paymails
    * Allows for viewing paymails
    * Revoking paymails (not working on local env because of CORS and some other errors)
6. Transactions
    * Viewing transaction data such as timestamp, sender, receiver, hash, etc.
7. +Transactions
    * Recording a transaction by passing Transaction ID or Hex string
    * Generic error messages, but looks like it's working fine
