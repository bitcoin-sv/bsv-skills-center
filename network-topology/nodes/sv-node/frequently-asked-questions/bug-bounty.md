# Bug Bounty

The Bitcoin SV Bug Bounty Program only applies to the code for the Bitcoin SV full node implementation.

We certainly appreciate any issues with the website reported to us. But as we use largely off the shelf products for the website and the website is informational in nature, the Bug Bounty Program does not apply to the website.
