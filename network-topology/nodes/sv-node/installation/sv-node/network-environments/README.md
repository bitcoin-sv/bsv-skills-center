# Network Environments

There are 4 defined “networks”:

* _mainnet_ – the main public network.&#x20;
* _STN_ (S_caling Test Network_) – a public test network targeted at testing scaling.&#x20;
* _testnet_ – a public test network, typically used for testing of software before release.&#x20;
* _regnet_ – a private “regression” test network, meant for local testing. &#x20;

Nodes from different networks can co-exist on the same physical network; each public network uses a different set of seed nodes (if any) and ports for communications.

The BSV server software defaults to _mainnet_.
