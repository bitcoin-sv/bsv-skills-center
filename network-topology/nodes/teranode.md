# Teranode

Teranode is the next-generation node software for the BSV Blockchain, designed to achieve massive scalability through a distributed microservices architecture. Unlike traditional monolithic node implementations, Teranode breaks down blockchain processing into specialized components that can scale horizontally across multiple servers.

The Teranode architecture enables the BSV network to process millions of transactions per second by parallelizing and distributing core blockchain functions including transaction validation, block assembly, mempool management, and state persistence. Key features include distributed processing across microservices, horizontal scalability to handle enterprise-level throughput, optimized resource utilization through specialized components, and support for the BSV network's unbounded scaling roadmap.

Teranode represents a fundamental reimagining of blockchain node infrastructure, moving from single-server limitations to a cloud-native distributed system capable of supporting global-scale applications. This architecture allows the BSV Blockchain to handle transaction volumes comparable to major payment networks while maintaining the security and decentralization properties of a public blockchain.

## Teratestnet: Help Validate Teranode

Developers are invited to participate in validating Teranode by running their own node on **Teratestnet**, a dedicated test network for the next-generation node software. The BSV Association has released the Teranode source code publicly and encourages community participation in testing and validation.

Running a Teratestnet node doesn't require specialized hardwareâ€”it can be done on a basic laptop using Docker. The setup process is streamlined through an automated bash script that handles network configuration, RPC credentials, and optional CPU mining setup.
