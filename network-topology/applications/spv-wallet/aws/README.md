The installation process described here should be treated as a foundation for configuring the environment to suit your specific business needs. While we recommend using observability tools such as AWS Cloud Watch, Kibana, or Prometheus, especially in a production environment, please note that these tools are not included in this installation. The configuration of these tools is left up to you.
