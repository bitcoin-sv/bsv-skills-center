   4. The first transaction is called the Input Transaction and it is used by the block winner to allocate the block rewards to their own accounts and provides means for additional functions such as node identification.
2. What must the value of the outputs be equal to or less than in a coinbase transaction.

   1. The funding of faucets.
   2. It subsidizes the transaction fees.
   3. Developer funding to build and modify the protocol.
