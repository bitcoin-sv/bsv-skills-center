The longest chain of Proof-of-Work is the chain of blocks generated by the largest pool of CPU power.

At scale, this means far more than just the capacity of nodes to solve the difficult proof of work problem, as a node must be able to keep up with the rest of the network in the tasks of downloading, validating and storing all of the transactions taking place in the world in real time.

The hashing machinery used to solve proof of work votes for the most capable node, incentivising node operators to build the fastest most capable machines in order to attract the most hash. Hash power can be switched instantaneously off or on, or even moved between nodes so ensuring it is being used profitably is a top priority.

In this way, the network stays healthy by incentivising node operators to invest in the best and most capable machinery to run the network.
