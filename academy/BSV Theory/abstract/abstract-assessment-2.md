# Abstract Assessment 2

A double spend refers to:

Sending a transaction and the recipient resending that same transaction back to you, instantly.

Sending a transaction and then resending the same transaction with a higher fee to the same address prior to the confirmation of the original transaction.

Sending a transaction and then sending a different transaction spending the same funds to a different address prior to confirmation of the original transaction.

Sending a single transaction that is split into two separate transactions that then arrive at the same destination address in order to increase privacy.
