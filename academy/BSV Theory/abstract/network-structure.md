The network forms naturally through the incentive structure that drives participation in usage of the ledger, and the corporate activity that revolves around processing transactions from the ledger into blocks.

Winning blocks can be a lucrative business activity for an efficient processor.

There is no central governance, and nodes simply need to adhere to the established rules in order to participate. As transaction fee revenue grows commensurate with network usage, individual node operators will invest in infrastructure that increases their capacity to validate all available transactions and gain access to a larger pool of fee revenue. This is not something that is governed by the network or any central party but rather driven by incentive to maximise profits by becoming more competitive with other nodes on the network.
