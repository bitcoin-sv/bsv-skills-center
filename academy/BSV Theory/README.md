# BSV Theory

BSV Theory covers the design of BSV as a system as prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto. This course is open to anyone who is interested in Bitcoin and is the beginner course in this series. Some technical experience would be helpful to complete the course, however it is open to anyone regardless of experience.

The course will go through the Bitcoin Whitepaper section by section elaborating on the concepts contained within each.
