# Businesses Running Nodes

> Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

A business that is making or receiving very large numbers of transactions may elect to operate their own node, participating in the process of receiving and validating all transactions on the network and vying for user hash power to be allocated to their node in order to win blocks.

This would allow a business to follow the longest valid chain very closely and to have full visibility of any attempted attack on the network, and any double spends that might be directed at them or any other businesses for whom they monitor accounts.

This opens up new business opportunities for major on-line payment processors to operate network systems and to enhance their own operational security at the same time.
