# Things the Attacker Cannot Achieve

> Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them.

This is one of the most important things to understand in this scenario. An attacker trying to make arbitrary changes to the network consensus rules, to create money that doesn’t exist or to spend funds in a way that doesn’t conform to the Bitcoin Protocol cannot attack Bitcoin in this way. This is because the blocks they create would be rejected by all nodes, forcing the attacker to maintain a fork of the network which essentially duplicates the entire block chain database and creates a separate network in which only nodes who agree with their version of consensus can participate.
