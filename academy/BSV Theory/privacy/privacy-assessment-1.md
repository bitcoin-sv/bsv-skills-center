# Privacy - Assessment 1



1. How does the traditional banking model achieve privacy for its users?
   1. By acting as a trusted guardian of the bank’s account holders data that is held on secured internal systems.
   2. &#x20;By using banking industry standard cyphers disseminated through public information channels.
   3. &#x20;By encrypting data to a public ledger.
   4. &#x20;All of the above.
2. What is a major security flaw that has led to many of the instances in which theft and fraud has occurred against bank account holders?
   1. Account holders managing a multitude of accounts using the same login key.
   2. &#x20;Not using network alert systems to detect incoming attempts to alter transactions.
   3. &#x20;Outdated infrastructure and legacy frameworks adapted to digital needs.
   4. &#x20;None of the above.
3. &#x20;Because most outputs in Bitcoin are locked with a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ i), it isn’t possible to remove all information about the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ii) from the transaction. By virtue of the fact that information provided to the payer is embedded in the transaction, the transaction itself \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ iii), so care must be taken by the receiver to retain their own \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ iv).
   1. i) private key, ii) sender’s identity, iii) is fully public, iv) anonymity
   2. &#x20;i) an input, ii) value of the bitcoins, iii) remains anonymous, iv) private accounting ledger
   3. &#x20;i) digital signature, ii) identity of the paying party, iii) becomes a receipt, iv) anonymity when transacting
   4. &#x20;i) script requiring a knowledge proof, ii) identity of the receiving party, iii) isn’t anonymous, iv) privacy
4. &#x20;How can a Bitcoin user still remain private?
   1. Users can remain private by not publishing their details onto the ledger as part of the transaction. Both parties to a transaction can make separate records for accounting purposes.
   2. &#x20;Users can remain private by separating digital signature data from the transaction. This excludes identifying information from the ledger and can be stored separately by the user.
   3. &#x20;Users cannot be private when using Bitcoin due to the transparent nature of its distributed ledger.
   4. &#x20;Users that wish to remain private must use anonymizing systems such as coin mixers and off chain payment channels to hide their transactions.
