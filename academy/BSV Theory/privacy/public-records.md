When both parties to a transaction utilise robust privacy measures to ensure that only they are privy to the details of the transaction, it becomes almost impossible for third parties who are outside the sphere of trust pertaining to the transaction to follow the details. This can be further augmented by breaking the payment into multiple outputs or even multiple transactions to further mask the details.

In this way it becomes very easy for lawful and considerate users of Bitcoin to guard their privacy and maintain a secure online presence.
