# Bitcoin Primitives: Digital Signatures

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/4JlmLePwlp0" %}

### Introduction

Overall, there are three foundational concepts that, if understood well, can make the initial learning journey for Bitcoin SV much easier. While the two  other concepts are Hash Functions and [Merkle Trees](https://bitcoinsv.academy/course/bitcoin-primitives-merkle-trees), the focus of this course is to cover the third concept - Digital Signatures.

As this is a beginner-level course, it assumes no knowledge of Bitcoin SV. There are many well-proven Digital Signature Schemes such as RSA (based upon the name of its inventors Rivest-Shamir-Addlemen), Digital Standard Signature, ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), used by enterprise products. For the scope of this course, our focus will only be on ECDSA as used in Bitcoin SV. In order to build a solid conceptual understanding, the course will progress in the following order: \
&#x20;\
Chapter 1 - What are Digital Signatures?\
Chapter 2 - ECDSA Pre-requisites\
Chapter 3 - ECDSA\
Chapter 4 - Bitcoin and Digital Signatures\
&#x20;\
Upon completion of this course, students will be awarded our certificate of completion.&#x20;
