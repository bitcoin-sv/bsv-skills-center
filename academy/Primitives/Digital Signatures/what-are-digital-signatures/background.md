# Background

Digital signatures are one of the most critical applications of asymmetric cryptography and have a vital and extensive utility in the digital world. Essentially, they are simply a unique numerical value, for instance, a string of 2048 bits. Algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA, and DSA are used to generate this numerical value.

With the world embracing digital commerce, digital signatures provide a means to safeguard communication between transacting parties by enabling properties such as tamper resistance and impersonation prevention. Therefore, it is critical to understand how these cryptographic methods offer security. Over the years, society has developed assurances on the implementations via laws related to digital signatures. Circa 2000, many countries legally defined rules wherein digital signatures were associated with legal bindings. The implications were that digitally signed contracts could be enforced under law in the same way as any agreement signed physically with ink on paper.&#x20;
