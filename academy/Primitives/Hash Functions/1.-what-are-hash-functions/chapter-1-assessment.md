d) HASH-360, RIPEMD-160, SHA-256, HASH-1024

&#x20;

2\. What are the 3 main difference between hash functions and encryption?

a) Hash functions are reversible, encryption has a collision risk, and encryption doesn't care about data loss.

b) Good hash functions are reversible, encryption doesn't care about data loss, and good hash functions have a collision risk.

**c) Good hash functions are one-way, encryption is reversible, and good hash functions have a collision risk although it's small.**

d) Encryption is not reversible, encryption is one-way, and encryption has a collision risk.

&#x20;

3\. What are the 3 important properties of good hash functions?

a) three image resistance, second image resistance, and collision resistance

**b) Collision resistance, preimage resistance, and second preimage resistance**
