# Chapter 7 - Assessment



&#x20;

1. Why is double hashing less secure than only using a hash function once?\
   a) It’s not\
   b) Double hashing is actually more secure\
   **c) Because its effectively doubles the likelihood of a collision**\
   d) Triple hashing is better\
   \

2. Why does Bitcoin use double hashes?\
   a) To facilitate a separation of concerns and make the system more robust and useful\
   b) To make it more secure, along with 1mb block sizes\
   c) To enable system specialization and spur efficiencies\
   **d) a & b**\
   e) a, b, & c\
   \

3. What’s the main drawback for using a central authority like a certificate authority?\
   a) It make issuing certificates and keys slow\
   **b) If the certificate authority gets compromised, the entire PKI system is compromised**\
   c) There isn’t one; CAs are great\
   d) They enable end-to-end encryption\
   \

4. What’s the one major problem with HMACs?\
   a) They don’t provide enough information to allow for proper encryption\
   b) They slow down hashing which can make programs too slow\
   c) They’re really difficult to implement\
   **d) They require communicating parties to share a secrete with each other before communicating**\
   \

5. What major features of Bitcoin allow for it solve double-spending and provide overall security?\
   a) The UTXO model\
   b) The first-seen-rule for transactions\
   c) The emergent small-world network\
   d) Proof-of-work\
   e) Nakamoto/Network consensus\
   **f) All of the above**
