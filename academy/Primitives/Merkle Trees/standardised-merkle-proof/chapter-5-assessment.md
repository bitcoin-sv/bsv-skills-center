# Chapter 5 - Assessment

**Question 1**

How does BUMP streamline the validation process for composite proofs?

* [ ] By allowing unlimited transaction inputs
* [x] By simplifying parsing and validation, despite the complexity of composite proofs&#x20;
* [ ] By automating transaction confirmations
* [ ] By decentralizing the validation process

&#x20;

**Question 2**

What essential components does a BUMP data structure include? (Choose two)

* [x] Block Height
* [ ] Transaction fees
* [x] Tree Height
* [ ] Wallet addresses

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Question 3**

Which encoding methods does BUMP utilize to accommodate various use cases?&#x20;

* [ ] Hexadecimal and ASCII
* [x] Binary and JSON
* [ ] Morse code and Braille
* [ ] Base64 and UTF-8

**Question 4**

In the BUMP format, what does the "duplicate" flag indicate when set to true for a leaf?

* [ ] That the leaf should be ignored
* [x] That the hash of the previous node should be duplicated
* [ ] That the leaf contains encrypted data
* [ ] That the leaf is a root node

**Question 5**

How does BUMP contribute to network efficiency?

* [ ] By increasing the number of transactions per block
* [x] By minimizing redundancy and enhancing data efficiency through consolidation
* [ ] By encrypting all transaction data
* [ ] By requiring fewer confirmations for each transaction



**Question 6**

What is the primary purpose of the BSV Unified Merkle Path (BUMP) format?

* [ ] To increase the block size
* [ ] To standardize transaction fees
* [x] To optimize the verification process for transactions&#x20;
* [ ] To encrypt transaction data
