# TSC Principles

The TSC operates under a set of 4 principles defined to ensure the committee operates to a very high standard, and always looks to make the best decision for the ecosystem at large. These principles are defined as follows:

1. **Industry-driven**: experts and companies, in response to a perceived need in their industry, take the lead deciding which standards should be developed, not the TSC.
2. **Created by experts**: industry experts are involved at all stages of the standard development process, from deciding whether a new standard is needed, to defining all the technical content and reviewing and monitoring industry adoption once published.
3. **Collaborative and objective**: an open process to ensure that all parties interested are offered the opportunity to be actively involved in the standard development. The recommended solution is a result of a consensus-based approach that fully considers comments gathered from stakeholders during both the internal and public review phases.
4. **Accountable and open**: TSC standard development follows transparent procedures. The implementation of standards is monitored and recorded internally with a summary of technical decisions and comments received made publicly available.
