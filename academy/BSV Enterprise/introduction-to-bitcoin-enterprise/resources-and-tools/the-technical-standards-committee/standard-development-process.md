# Standard Development Process

Technical standards are created by working groups formed from experts in the necessary subject matter. A strong focus is placed on meeting the needs of the organisations and sectors that they represent and of the wider ecosystem. These industry experts drive the standardisation process, and are involved at all stages of standard development, the initial decision whether a new standard is needed, the subsequent definition of technical content, final review process and post-publication monitoring of industry adoption. The TSC oversees the process, acting as facilitators and offering the platforms, rules, governance, methodologies, and access to specialists such as technical writers to objectively address the standards development lifecycle. Each standard's working group is assigned a TSC sponsor to guide its development lifecycle.

The sponsors independently oversee the working group using their own methods while ensuring policies and processes are maintained and guaranteeing high quality outputs that reinforce the relevance of industry and technology standards.

The standard development process is split into three stages:

**1. Submission**

The submission phase of the standardisation process describes the activities undertaken from initially identifying a business need through to the formation of a working group that will drive the standard forwards to completion.

**2. Drafting and Review**

The drafting and review phase of the standardisation process describes the activities undertaken from the successful formation of a working group through to completion of a final, reviewed draft.

**3. Standardisation**

During the standardisation phase, the standard is published on the TSC website. A period of time is allowed for during which the TSC and the working group monitor adoption and implementations. This period of time is determined by the scale and scope of the standard. Once elapsed, the TSC make a final decision (through majority vote) on whether to promote the publication to recommended, make further modifications or to withdraw the standard.
