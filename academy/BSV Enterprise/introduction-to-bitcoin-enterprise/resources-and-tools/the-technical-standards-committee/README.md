# The Technical Standards Committee

Part of the work undertaken by the BSV Association includes the formation and management of a Technical Standards Committee (https://tsc.bitcoinassociation.net) focused on delivering a robust and feature-packed set of standards, which will simplify the process of interconnecting services and products operating on the BSV Blockchain.

The committee promotes technical excellence and furthers BSVâ€™s utility by enhancing interoperability through standardisation, facilitating industry participation in the development of global standards, and ensuring technical standards are maintained and freely available.

Working groups are formed to evaluate and progress each separate standard, with current developments covering a wide array of service needs and requirements in parallel.

The committee itself does not decide when to develop a new standard, but allows the process to be industry-driven. Individuals or companies who wish to develop or accelerate proposals are encouraged to come forward and participate. Visit this website to submit a proposal to the TSC: https://tsc.bitcoinassociation.net/standards.
