# The Protocol - Simple, Robust and Unbounded

One of the most important aspects of BSV Blockchain is that its protocol is set in stone. As discussed on the previous page, this does not mean that the node client cannot be updated or otherwise customised, but it does mean that any node clients being used on the network must be capable of validly interpreting and expressing the Bitcoin protocol.

As a foundational technology for tomorrow's financial products and services, it is of vital importance that people building with the BSV protocol have certainty that the systems and software they produce today will continue to operate for many years into the future without having to worry that node client developers might decide to modify the protocol in such a way that those products and services cease to function. This has been an issue in the past, and while changes were introduced into the protocol during its first 10 years, network node operators are much more aware of their responsibility as stewards of the system and have made a commitment to make no further changes to the protocol beyond those needed to restore it back to its original functional capability.
