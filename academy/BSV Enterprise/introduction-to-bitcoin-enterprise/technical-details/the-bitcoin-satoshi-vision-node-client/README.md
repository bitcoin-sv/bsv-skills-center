# The Bitcoin Satoshi Vision Node Client

The BSV network is the infrastructure all network users (applications, services, and users) rely upon, with the nodes sitting tightly connected at its core.

A blockchain network's performance is only as good as its infrastructure and software. In the case of BSV Blockchain, the SV node client is used by the vast majority of node operators. This client is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin node client released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, and extensive efforts have been made to maximize scaling within the limits of its single server architecture.

The node client offers features such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC) functionality to broadcast and analyse transactions and analyse blocks and other network activity. The client has been optimised to focus on the utilities required to operate a node which is actively working to extend the blockchain by building blocks and performing proof of work, rather than as a wallet for network users to send and receive funds.
