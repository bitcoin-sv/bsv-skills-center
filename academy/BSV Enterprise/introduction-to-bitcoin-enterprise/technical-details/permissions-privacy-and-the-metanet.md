# Permissions, Privacy and the Metanet

Through BSV Blockchain's highly flexible and expressive scripting language, people using BSV can express any type of spending condition or permission-based requirement and place it on the objects they are using within their platform.

With this flexibility, and the use of a second layer data protocol that nests within BSV transactions, it becomes simple to imagine, design and then build applications for diverse use cases on the blockchain.&#x20;

Allowing permissions to be enforced by the consensus layer is a tremendously valuable feature for a second layer, as it gives every action inside the ‘ledger’ used by the platform a way of being controlled, listed, indexed and more, without the need for complicated multi-token logic.
