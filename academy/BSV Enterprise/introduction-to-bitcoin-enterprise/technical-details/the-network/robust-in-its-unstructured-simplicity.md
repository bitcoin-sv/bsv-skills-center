# Robust In Its Unstructured Simplicity

Thanks to the simple nature of Bitcoin's protocol and the very high density of connections at the network's core, the functionality of the system remains robust even under extreme modes of failure such as the loss of a majority of nodes on the network. Thanks to BSV's unbounded block size, the impact to users of the system in such a scenario is minimal.

Through its use of Proof of Work, the network functions effectively without any centralised direction or leadership. Nodes all follow the same rules, and proof of work allows them to easily identify each other in what can be an otherwise chaotic and noisy environment. Using this method of establishing capability and intent, nodes can collaborate easily and effectively in an open and honest manner. Node operators have the ability to reject the activity of any other node acting in a manner that is dishonest or otherwise breaks the network's established rules either as a group or individually. This gives operators a collective means of strongly disincentivizing malicious or illegal behaviour.

Those interested in gaining a more in-depth understanding of the BSV network are strongly encouraged to take the Introduction to BSV Infrastructure course which covers the incentives and processes driving node operators to invest in enhancing the performance and capacity of the network’s infrastructure in detail.
