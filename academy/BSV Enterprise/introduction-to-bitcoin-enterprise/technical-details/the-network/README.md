# The Network

The BSV network is the infrastructure all network users (applications, services, and users) rely upon, with the nodes sitting tightly connected at its core.

Nodes are defined as systems which gather and process transactions, timestamping them into blocks through the process defined in Section 5 of the Bitcoin white paper.

Driven by BSV's game changing economic incentives, the network spontaneously forms into a densely connected and highly robust small world network which allows the most capable nodes in the system to succeed in their roles as transaction validators by building blocks to extend the public ledger. It is the role of these operators to use these highly capable, purpose-built machines to construct the blockchain at the core of the system as part of a competitive enterprise within which they compete in a rapidly repeating game.
