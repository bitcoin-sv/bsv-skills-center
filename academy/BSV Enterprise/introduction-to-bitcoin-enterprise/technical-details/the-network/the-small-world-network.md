# The Small World Network

As the network grows, the nodes who demonstrate their capability to generate blocks reliably and honestly are incentivised to create a dense web of high-bandwidth connections to each other to ensure that they are able to both transmit and receive new transactions and block announcements in as close to real time as possible. This highly interconnected core at the centre of the network forms what is known as a 'small world network' and enables a level of hyper-awareness of the activities of other nodes. This collective awareness allows each node to show openly their intent regarding any particular transaction or block and is a major incentive in the development of the network's structure.

Importantly, within this small world network, nodes manage each other, and their connections with each other. Only by building blocks by using proof-of-work to win the right to add them to the chain can nodes enforce the network rules and policies by which transactions are accepted. Despite a lack of central direction, this method of reaching consensus ensures that only the most honest and capable systems who will benefit from investments in connectivity from their peers.
