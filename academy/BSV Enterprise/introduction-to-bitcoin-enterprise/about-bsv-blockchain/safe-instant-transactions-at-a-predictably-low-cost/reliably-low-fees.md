# Reliably Low Fees

The BSV network is built to accommodate at least an order of magnitude more transactions than the typical demand generates so that there is no market-based fee pressure such as is seen on other blockchain networks. This allows miners to set low, stable transaction prices for users.  Bitcoin was always meant to scale without limits, and it’s this scaling that drives a positive user experience, and a sustainable block reward.

As more transaction volume is processed by the network, fee revenue increases for the miners and competitive forces imply that transaction processing will be offered by more capable nodes at the best possible rate. This competition ensures that as the network accommodates more and more volume, and fees come down, more use cases will become economically viable at a cheaper fee rate, and volume will increase rewarding the more capable nodes who broker deals to process the cheaper transactions. This combination of supply and demand and economies of scale means that as the network throughput increases, it will create more use cases and society will reap the many benefits of this increased efficiency in interoperability, accountability and value capture.
