# Comparison to Legacy Transaction Systems

It is also important to understand that valid transactions which are submitted to the network can be considered cleared and settled within just a few seconds of their submission to network nodes. Checking the status of a transaction is also quick and easy and can be automated within wallet software.

Typically, simple transactions via the BSV network cost approximately 0.0005c USD, allowing for 1,000,000 transactions to be processed for just $100. These transactions are similarly capable of transferring value in sub-cent denominations. When compared to a typical credit card transaction that might cost 25c USD, this is a 2500x reduction in cost. In addition, transactions are processed in a way that eliminates chargebacks and other business risks that often require vendors to increase their margins, affecting consumer prices. These unique characteristics allow developers to leverage the BSV Blockchain as the substrate technology for their platforms and to implement business models that have been heretofore impossible using legacy digital payment systems.
