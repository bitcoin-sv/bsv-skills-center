# The Bitcoin White Paper

In 2020, Dr Craig Wright was awarded copyright over the Bitcoin white paper (www.bitcoinsv.io/bitcoin.pdf) published in 2008 by the United States copyright office. This copyright is essential to the protection of Bitcoin against other projects who lay claim to being the original Bitcoin and protects the white paper as a foundational document outlining the functionality of Bitcoin as a system, a network and a ledger of exchange.

The following video is a reading of the Bitcoin white paper, with animations to assist with comprehension. For students who want to gain a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of this document, we recommend enrolling in Introduction to Bitcoin Theory.
