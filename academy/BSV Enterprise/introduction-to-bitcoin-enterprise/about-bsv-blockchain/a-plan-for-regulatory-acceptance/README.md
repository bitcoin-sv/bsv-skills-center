# A Plan for Regulatory Acceptance

In so much of the cryptocurrency and blockchain landscape, there is evidence of scant regard for legal process and regulations, the argument being that the technology is so new that law and regulations cannot be applied. This is no truer than the laws covering media ownership being applied to a new medium of service and it can be shown that not only can BSV Blockchain work within the frameworks of current laws and regulations, but that it was designed in such a way as to make adherence to legal requirements both simple and affordable.

Bitcoin was never created to subvert the legal system or destroy central banks, but rather as a tool to be used to build new platforms and services in ways that are far more efficient, scalable and profitable. Micropayment based business models are only possible with efficient, ultra-low-cost, payments.

Each satoshi issued on the ledger can be used to carry data or items of far higher value than just themselves, providing an effective substrate system for all manner of products and services to operate in ways that are compliant with any legal requirement.
