# Ready-made Compliance Tools

An important part of the work being done by the Technical Standards Committee (TSC) is implementing and servicing a set of ready-made tools that help enterprises building platforms remain compliant with stringent regulations easily and cheaply, including internationally applied, 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) and 'Anti Money Laundering' (AML) rules. Every Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) must comply when dealing with high value transfers. In addition, systems such as Paymail/BSVAlias are available to assist businesses in simply and easily managing customer identity in ways that minimize liability without impacting customer privacy.

The TSC is constantly developing new standards to deliver fast, low-cost digital services that exceed the functionality of their legacy counterparts to ensure every platform built on BSV Blockchain is ready for the regulations of today and the future.
