# Big Blocks Show Big Potential

As of 2024, BSV nodes are already regularly processing blocks containing over one million transactions and up to 4GB in size.

To ensure the network scales smoothly the BSV node software team's focus is on optimizing software performance - and keeping the underlying base protocol consistent helps them do this. In addition to helping nodes scale, the continuous efficiency improvements, and unchanging base protocol of the BSV node software help ensure the network is robust in the event it loses significant processing power. Scaling the node client and the systems that run it is a key pillar of the network's robust architecture and capability.

Importantly, because nodes must win blocks to get paid, and the probability of getting paid goes up significantly when nodes who have significant capacity and processing power are well-connected to each other, the network will always be able to accommodate demand, no matter how much it grows.

BSV's sophisticated economic incentives also encourage nodes to be assertive in their strategies to increase their throughput capabilities to attract more fee revenue. Yet, at the same time, the incentive structure is designed to ensure that they cannot do this in a fashion that outpaces the rest of the nodes on the network.

BSV is a co-operative meritocratic system. The more ambitious and competitive a node is, the greater the reward they can win, with the caveat that nodes must also be completely open and honest with each other to maximize their efficiency. The rules of this economic game grow rewards and ensure mutually beneficial behaviour for all network participants.

These behaviours can all be described from the perspective of the individual node operators on the network acting in their own self-interest. There is no place or altruism in the function of the network ensuring that an open competition exists at all times to deliver the best possible service to all users of the system.

For students who want to learn more about the operation of the BSV network, we strongly encourage you to take the Introduction to BSV Infrastructure course.
