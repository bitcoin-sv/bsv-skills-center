# Scalability to Accommodate Global Demand

One of the most important aspects of the BSV blockchain is its ability to scale without bounds, giving it the potential to manage hundreds of millions or even billions of transactions every second. In 2009, Bitcoin was released with no limits on block-size, transaction size, script complexity or use of opcodes. Between 2010 and 2017, numerous changes were made to the base protocol that restricted its ability to scale. However, since 2018, teams developing the BSV node client software have worked to restore the original unbounded protocol design.

In addition to its unbounded incentive structure, Bitcoin script also comes with op\_codes future proofing it to work well with IPV6, and extra op\_codes to add additional hashing functions if needed. Furthermore, as IPV6 subsumes IPV4, BSV will become instrumental in supporting the anticipated billions of IoT devices expected to come online.

By way of micro-transactions, BSV blockchain will be the global validation and timestamping service providing an effective way to clean data and communications, maintaining integrity and supercharging AI & Machine Learning.

As the ideas of the Metaverse and Web3 are turned into real products and services, a dedicated technological substrate capable of processing hundreds of transactions per user each hour will be critical. Realising these products and services will be otherwise impractical or maybe impossible due to the inefficiency of legacy data and payment networks which aren't designed from the ground up with these usage conditions in mind.
