# Building Foundations on a Bedrock of Stone

Just like how the granite bedrock in Manhattan provides the necessary base for one of the highest concentrations of skyscrapers in the world, having a stable, unchanging, base protocol gives entrepreneurs and investors the confidence to put the necessary time and money it takes to build applications and businesses on BSV. When businesses depend on a technology and that technology is continuously changing, it creates situations where their applications and processes become inoperable. When it comes to the BSV Blockchain, this can mean the network becomes inaccessible for applications or services that depend on it, or worse, pre-signed transactions scheduled to take place at some point in the future can no longer be processed.

This can be likened to building a castle on a foundation of sand, where the shifting media under the foundations of its wall might cause it to eventually collapse.

Since the stewards and arbiters of the BSV network have committed to an unchanging base protocol, builders can trust that the applications and businesses they put their time, effort, and money into will not be disrupted or rendered inoperable based on the unfettered whims of a small developer group who in most cases have no experience building businesses.
