# Protocol Stability

One of the most important aspects that will contribute to the uptake, longevity and reliability of BSV Blockchain is its stability as a protocol. In the period from 2010 to 2018, the Bitcoin protocol was changed in several fundamental ways by node client developers seeking to 'fix' what they erroneously perceived to be 'problems' with the system. The fixing created further downstream problems in many areas and generated significant angst for developers building applications and businesses using the system at the time.

This lack of certainty meant they could never be sure that what they were building would continue to work or would be rendered inoperable by unsolicited, and unnecessary, changes to the base protocol.

With the release of the BSV node client, node operators, the arbiters of the network, have committed to a policy of making no further changes to the protocol save those which undo changes already made such as the removal of transaction and block size limits and the re-enabling of disabled functionality in the scripting language.
