# Example

Consider an example of Bitcoin’s use as a data store for applications outside monetary exchange:

In almost all cases of computer hacking, one of the first actions attackers take is to delete logs that could reveal their activities. When systems rely on trusted third parties to maintain these logs, there’s always the risk that the third party itself has been compromised.

Bitcoin provides a solution. Logs can be written as transactions to the Bitcoin Ledger. Once written, these logs cannot be deleted or tampered with. Because the Bitcoin Ledger is distributed across a peer-to-peer network, it eliminates concerns about single points of failure. This creates an unalterable, verifiable record, ensuring data integrity even in the face of malicious attacks.

#### **The BSV Blockchain Advantage**

While the concept of using Bitcoin as a global data ledger was part of its original design, other implementations of the Bitcoin protocol have deviated from this vision. The **BSV blockchain**, however, uniquely scales to support unbounded data storage and transaction throughput. By preserving the economic incentives and design principles of the original Bitcoin protocol, BSV enables practical, scalable use cases for data integrity, utility, and transparency at a global scale.
