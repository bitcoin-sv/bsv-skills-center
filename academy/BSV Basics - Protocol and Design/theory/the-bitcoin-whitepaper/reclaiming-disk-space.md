# Reclaiming Disk Space

Here Satoshi provides a guideline for nodes to reclaim disk space to deal with a constantly growing Ledger. He mentions that spent transactions written sufficiently far back in the Ledger can be discarded and nodes can simply keep hashes to maintain integrity of the system. He cites Mooreâ€™s Law as proof that storage of the Ledger should not be a concern.
