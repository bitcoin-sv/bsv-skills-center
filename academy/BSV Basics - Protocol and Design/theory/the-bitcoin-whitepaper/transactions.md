# Transactions

A coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures. We are introduced to the concept that coins are transferred from one owner to another owner with the use of digital signatures. We are reminded that the only way to know if a transaction is valid is if we have a solution to the double spending problem. The solution is hinted at here: transactions are announced publicly. We see that a key piece of Bitcoinâ€™s innovation is the public nature of the system.
