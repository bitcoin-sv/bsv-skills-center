# Network

Nodes are defined clearly as those that participate in the creation of blocks. There are a clearly defined set of rules that all nodes in the network are required to follow. This section details the role of nodes in the network and also how nodes resolve any conflicts in agreement on the state of the Ledger. This conflict resolution is typically referred to as Nakamoto Consensus.
