# Triple Entry Accounting

Bitcoin introduces a groundbreaking improvement. Every transaction is digitally signed, creating a **public receipt** that serves as the third entry in this new accounting model. This receipt is recorded in the **BSV Ledger**, enabling anyone to verify the existence or non-existence of a transaction. This transparency and verifiability fundamentally enhance the reliability of financial records.

The BSV Ledger acts as a global database for monetary transactions. Just as accounting ledgers have historically documented economic activity, the BSV Ledger provides a global, public record that serves as proof—showing that Bob paid Alice, Alice paid Jim, and so on.

BSV's Ledger has far-reaching implications beyond simple monetary exchanges. As mentioned earlier, transactions also carry a data component. For example, if Bob pays Alice 3 coins, this transaction might require only 1 kilobyte (KB) of data in the ledger.

BSV also supports more complex transactions. For instance:

* A transaction where Bob pays Alice and Jim 1 coin each might use 1.1 KB of data.
* A transaction with a thousand recipients might require 3 KB.

This flexibility transforms BSV into a **global data ledger**—a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) database where any amount of data can be written at any time. With its immutable properties, BSV enables a reliable method of validating data integrity.

In 2005, Ian Grigg coined the term "Triple Entry Accounting" to describe how digital signatures could enhance traditional double-entry accounting. In traditional accounting, a debit is recorded in one ledger, and a credit is recorded in another to account for a transaction. However, this method can fail during audits if credits and debits don’t align.

Bitcoin introduces a groundbreaking improvement. Every transaction is digitally signed, creating a **public receipt** that serves as the third entry in this new accounting model. This receipt is recorded in the **Bitcoin Ledger**, enabling anyone to verify the existence or non-existence of a transaction. This transparency and verifiability fundamentally enhance the reliability of financial records.

**Beyond Monetary Transactions**

Bitcoin’s Ledger has far-reaching implications beyond simple monetary exchanges. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin transactions carry a data component. For example, if Bob pays Alice 3 bitcoins, this transaction might require only 1 kilobyte (KB) of data in the ledger.

Bitcoin also supports more complex transactions. For instance:

* A transaction where Bob pays Alice and Jim 1 bitcoin each might use 1.1 KB of data.
* A transaction with a thousand recipients might require 3 KB.

What’s critical to understand is that **there is no fixed limit to the amount of data a transaction can include**. The only constraint is economic feasibility, as determined by the nodes processing the transaction.

This flexibility transforms Bitcoin into a **global data ledger**—a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) database where any amount of data can be written at any time. With its immutable properties, Bitcoin enables a reliable method of validating data integrity.
