# 14 - SIGHASH flags

The Sighash flags determine which parts of the transaction are being signed.

This value impacts other elements of the pre-image including hashPrevouts, hashSequence and hashOutputs. The SIGHASH flags are all contained within the last single byte of a signature, however in the pre-image they are contained within a 4 byte value, where the left-most byte is the SIGHASH flag applied to the signature, and the remaining 3 bytes are zero.

Sighash flags work as follows:

### SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY

SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY determines which of the transaction inputs the signature covers.

If SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY **is not** set, the signature must include all of the transaction inputs in the hash\_nSequence and hash\_prevouts values.

If SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY **is** set, only the input that the signature is applied to needs to be included. Because the previous output and nSequence are handled otherwise, both hash\_nSequence and hash\_prevouts are set to 32byte null strings when SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY is set. SIGHASH\_ANYONECANPAY can be useful when signing an input in advance of other transaction participants, where other inputs may be unknown.

### SIGHASH\_ALL, SIGHASH\_SINGLE, SIGHASH\_NONE

Only one of SIGHASH\_ALL, SIGHASH\_SINGLE and SIGHASH\_NONE can be used in any signature. If more than one of these flags is set, the transaction will be invalid.

If SIGHASH\_ALL is used, the signature must include all of the transaction outputs when it builds the pre-image.

If SIGHASH\_SINGLE is used, the signature must include only the transaction output at the same index as the input being signed in the pre-image.&#x20;

If SIGHASH\_NONE is used, none of the transaction's outputs are included in the pre-image.

### SIGHASH\_FORKID

SIGHASH\_FORKID is a flag that was added to the signatures after August 1 2017 to provide replay protection against the BTC network when it was separated from Bitcoin to add segregated witness. SIGHASH\_FORKID must ALWAYS be set, or the transactions will be invalid.&#x20;

#### Example: Checking SIGHASH flags

<table><thead><tr><th width="237.33333333333331">Stack</th><th>Script</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x3C;r_tx_preimg></td><td>...</td><td>Because nSequence is the final 4 byte value, we do not need to know what parts of r_tx_preimg remain to be able to extract it.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;r_tx_preimg></td><td>OP_SIZE</td><td>Put the size of r_tx_preimg on the stack</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;r_tx_preimg> &#x3C;size></td><td>OP_4</td><td>SIGHASH length is 4 bytes long</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;r_tx_preimg> &#x3C;size> 0x04</td><td>OP_SUB</td><td>Calculate split location</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;r_tx_preimg> &#x3C;split_length></td><td>OP_SPLIT</td><td>Split the pre-image</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;lr_tx_preimg> &#x3C;sighash></td><td>OP_NIP</td><td>Remove remainder</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;sighash></td><td>&#x3C;required_sighash></td><td>Load the required sighash flag onto the stack as a 1 byte value</td></tr><tr><td>&#x3C;sighash> &#x3C;required_sighash></td><td>OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY</td><td>Use numeric equality check to validate that the correct sighash is used.</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>rest of script</td></tr></tbody></table>

In this script, we first use OP\_SIZE to push the length of r\_tx\_preimg to the stack. By subtracting 4 from this, we can calculate the location in the remaining pre-image where the sighash element begins, and use that value to split it from r\_tx\_preimg. Once sighash is on the stack, it is a simple numeric equality check against a supplied sighash.

Alternative scenarios include using a bitwise mask and performing AND/OR checks against individual flags rather than enforcing the entire sighash state.
