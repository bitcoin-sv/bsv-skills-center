   * [ ] They needed to change the signature message format
   * [ ] They needed to add the OP\_PUSH\_TX opcode
   * [ ] They needed to create a special queue to receive transactions that use OP\_PUSH\_TX
   * [ ] They didn't need to do anything as this is part of the native functionality of Bitcoin <-
4. How can you tell if you are using the official version of OP\_PUSH\_TX
   * [ ] There is a website where you can check
