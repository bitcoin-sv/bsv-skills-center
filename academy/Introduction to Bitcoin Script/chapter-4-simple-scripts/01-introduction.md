# 01 - Introduction

In this chapter we will look at some simple script templates. Some of these are commonly used (e.g. P2PKH) and for those of you with some knowledge of Bitcoin will be familiar.

For each template, we will do a full breakdown of the script being solved in the evaluation engine including a table showing the state of the stack at each step, the opcodes being used and then present an animation to help you visualise the activity taking place.

Bitcoin script templates are an important part of your toolset and being able to create simple, efficient templates for the applications you are designing is a critical part of being an effective Bitcoin Script engineer.
