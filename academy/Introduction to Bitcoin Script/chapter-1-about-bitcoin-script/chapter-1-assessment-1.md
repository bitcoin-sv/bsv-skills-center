A Bitcoin transaction ID is the double SHA256 hash of the serialised transaction string. The first hash of the string is called the 'intermediate' hash.

Take the serialised transaction from above, and generate the intermediate hash (you must tell it that the data is hex, rather than text). If you take that output and hash it again, and you will see the result is the TXID of the transaction above in little endian format.

1\. Which is the intermediate hash?
