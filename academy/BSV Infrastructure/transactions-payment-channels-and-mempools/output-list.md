The next part of a transaction message is a list of outputs. Each output is a structured data item containing the following information:

1. Value - Indicates the value in satoshis associated with the output, given as an 8-byte little-endian value representing a non-negative integer.
2. Output script length (TxOut-script length) - The length of the output script in bytes, given as a 1-9 byte VarInt.
3. Output script (TxOut-script) - The serialised output script. This is often also referred to as a scriptPubKey. Each scriptPubKey defines locking/spending conditions that must be satisfied by a future unlocking script in order to spend the output.
