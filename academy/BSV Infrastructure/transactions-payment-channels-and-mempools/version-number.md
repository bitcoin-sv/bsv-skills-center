A transactionâ€™s version number is a 4 byte field in little endian format. The version number represents the version of the data format of the transaction and can be set by the transaction creator. Currently only version numbers 1 and 2 are accepted on the network.

When validating a transaction, a node checks that the version number is one of the acceptable values. In the future, it is anticipated that a node may determine whether to validate transactions with a particular version number based on legal or regulatory conditions.
