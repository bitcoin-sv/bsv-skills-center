# Assessment 1



_Students must receive a score of 4/5 to proceed. All questions are multiple choice questions._

1. What happens to the network when nodes leave or are disconnected?
   1. Nothing.  ✓
   2. It can fracture the small world network.&#x20;
   3. If enough nodes leave at the same time the network could stall.&#x20;
   4. The network becomes less efficient.&#x20;
2. Why do nodes spontaneously form a Small World Network?
   1. The result of asymmetrical game theory.&#x20;
   2. It helps them to quickly propagate transactions and blocks.  ✓
   3. The rules force them to or they will be disconnected from the network.&#x20;
   4. It makes the network more decentralised.
3. The requirement to  \_\_\_\_\_\_ in order to submit a block creates a fair barrier to participation in the consensus process, since only \_\_\_\_\_ can impact the network rules.
   1. collect and organize transactions, valid transactions&#x20;
   2. validate transactions, nodes&#x20;
   3. show proof-of-work, valid blocks  ✓
   4. be a node, blocks&#x20;
4. What role does altruism play in the network?
   1. None.  ✓
   2. It forms the basis for some of the incentives.&#x20;
   3. The sharing of block data is mutually beneficial.&#x20;
   4. It is the basis for many of the incentives.&#x20;
5. **Which are strong incentives for a node to build very low latency connections to the nodes that are most likely to find a block (select all that apply)?**
   1. The First Seen Rule.  ✓
   2. To be able to share and spread block information readily.  ✓
   3. Minimising the potential to waste proof-of-work on already surpassed previous block hashes.  ✓
   4. Reducing the number of orphan blocks.  ✓
