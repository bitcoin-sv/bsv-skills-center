# Novel Service Delivery Methods

Using payment channels, Bitcoinâ€™s ability to operate as a network layer means services can now be delivered inside the same financial instrument that will pay for them. This vastly simplifies payments, making them cheap enough that single cent transactions become cost-effective to make.

This change will engender a completely new user experience, where payments happen often, but for small amounts. These amounts can accumulate in a payment channel, terminating periodically (e.g. monthly) with a transfer of funds. Instead of paying up front for an entire movie to stream, you will be able to pay for what you watch and if you turn it off after a few minutes closing the payment channel will mean you only paid for what you viewed rather than the movie in its entirety as in legacy models.\\
