Merchant API (mAPI) is an additional service that miners can offer to merchants and network users.

It allows merchants to open direct lines of communication with nodes identified via MinerID to perform services such as:

* getting fee quotes
* submitting transactions
* querying the status of transactions

Node operators run mAPI as a service adjacent to the node itself. It is a value add service providing user certainty.
