1. The record of all spendable bitcoin forms a database referred to as what?
   1. The UTXO set.  ✓
   2. The ledger.&#x20;
   3. The blockchain.&#x20;
   4. The rapid access memory database.&#x20;
2. What is held within the UTXO set?
   1. The outputs that meet both the global network rules and the local node policies.&#x20;
   2. Every spendable output which has not yet been used as an input to a transaction.  ✓
   3. The history of every transaction made on the network.&#x20;
   4. The Merkle proofs and transaction output scripts of all bitcoins.&#x20;
3. When a node joins the network it is required to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. This involves downloading and validating a complete set of all of the blocks in the longest valid chain of proof of work, and using the information contained within to reconstruct the current state of the \_\_\_\_\_\_.
   1. validate the most recent block, block chain.&#x20;
   2. perform proof-of-work, block being validated.&#x20;
   3. conduct an initial block download, UTXO set.  ✓
   4. download the UTXO set, network.&#x20;
4. How can nodes build their own working blockchain?
   1. By only retaining the spendable transactions.&#x20;
   2. Through a logical removal of redundant information.  ✓
   3. With the help of trusted parties providing specific UTXO sets.&#x20;
   4. All of the above.&#x20;
5. Users can utilize their own working blockchain using only  \_\_\_\_\_, a service can receive transactions and their corresponding \_\_\_\_\_\_, using them to create \_\_\_\_\_ database of personalized information for the user.
   1. A UTXO set, blockheaders, a personalized.&#x20;
   2. the block headers, Merkle proofs, an immutable.  ✓
   3. the desired TXIDs, UTXO set, an optimized.&#x20;
   4. the Merkle proofs, blockheaders, a secure.&#x20;
