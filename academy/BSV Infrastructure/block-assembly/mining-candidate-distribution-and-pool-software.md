# Mining Candidate Distribution and Pool Software

Periodically, a node generates a block template, or a set of transactions with a complete Merkle tree. Using this template, it can create mining candidates for hashing. Each mining candidate is a aggregate of the parameters in the block header, including the previous block hash, the version of the block, the difficulty value and the timestamp. This is distributed plus some specific data the node uses to track the hasher being allocated the template.

These mining candidates are distributed to systems which control ASIC miners. These systems are often referred to as ‘pool-miners’ or ‘hash-pooling systems’.

When a pool-miner requests a mining candidate from a node, it is given the following information:

1. id - A universally unique identifier (uuid - link to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally\_unique\_identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) representing an assignment ID which identifies which pool a winning block hash was generated by
2. prevHash - A 32 byte string representing the previous block’s hash
3. A suggested coinbase transaction including the input string and any outputs the node requests (optional parameter)
4. version - A 4 byte string representing the version of the block
5. coinbaseValue - An 8 byte number representing the value of the combined outputs in the coinbase transaction in Satoshis
6. nBits - A 4 byte number representing the target difficulty
7. time - The time in 4 byte Unix epoch time accurate to 1 second
8. height - A varInt containing the height of the candidate block
9. merkleProof - An array containing a list of hex strings that represent the Merkle path for the coinbase transaction

With these values, the pool-miner has all of the information it needs to perform an unbounded amount of proof-of-work.\
