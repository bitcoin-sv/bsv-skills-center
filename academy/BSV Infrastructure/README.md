# Introduction

Introduction to BSV Infrastructure is focused on providing students with a solid understanding of the role that nodes and node operators play in the construction of the network. In particular it will focus on the incentives that drive enterprise operators to spend large sums of money to build and operate their infrastructure.

The coursework builds from the material outlined in the Bitcoin white paper which is widely distributed and is accessible here: [http://www.bitcoinsv.io/bitcoin.pdf](http://www.bitcoinsv.io/bitcoin.pdf).

For any students who have not read the white paper, you are encouraged to do so in a reasonable degree of detail before continuing the course. To gain a much more in-depth understanding, also consider taking the course [Introduction to Bitcoin Theory](http://bitcoinsv.academy/course/introduction-to-bitcoin-theory), which breaks the white paper down section-by-section to deliver a thorough and succinct overview of its function.

Upon completion of this course, students will be awarded a Certificate 1.
