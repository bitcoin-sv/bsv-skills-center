# Standard Local Policies

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/p7cSWRd-ypU" %}

Policies are settings that are configured by software operators. These settings are generally required by software implementations. It is expected that as implementations of the software mature that these settings will be adjusted.

Policies control which transactions the software will propagate across the P2P network or include in a block. However, policies are not Bitcoin Rules or Consensus Rules and are not used to determine the validity of blocks or the transactions confirmed by a block.
