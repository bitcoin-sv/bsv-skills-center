### P2P Network Connection Policies

Nodes on the Bitcoin network are free to connect or disconnect to any device, user or service that the incentive structure of the network encourages them to connect to. Certain nodes will operate with very different interconnection policies than other nodes, and nodes are free to reject or shut down connections as they see fit.

Each nodeâ€™s settings are unique and the Bitcoin node client also contains a robust set of conditional monitoring systems which will cause disruptive nodes to be automatically disconnected if they propagate invalid blocks or transactions.

### Propagation of Non-Standard Transactions

The local policy on the Propagation of non-standard transactions controls whether the software will propagate non-standard transactions to other peers on the P2P network.

Before Genesis activation, the default setting for this policy was that non-standard transactions will not be propagated across the P2P Network.

After Genesis activation, the default setting for this policy is that non-standard transactions will be propagated across the P2P Network.

Note that even though non-standard transactions will be propagated across the P2P Network after Genesis activation, other policies such as the Maximum Acceptable Transaction Size Policy remain in effect.
