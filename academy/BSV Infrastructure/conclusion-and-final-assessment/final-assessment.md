Once a valid proof-of-work is found by hashers, it is distributed to nodes which send it to Pool Miners in order to be proposed to the network as the valid record of events having occurred on the ledger.&#x20;

Pool Miners operate nodes as a for profit service allowing those with ASICs to connect directly to a pool which automatically directs the block creation effort.&#x20;

**23. How are nodes incentivized to accept it’s competitors' blocks quickly?**

Too long of a delay in validating competitors’ blocks could result in the node being disconnected from the network.&#x20;

Nodes that accept competitors’ blocks quickly are seen as competent nodes that are worthwhile for other nodes to share information with.&#x20;

All of the above.&#x20;

**24. What is a mempool?**

It retains transactions that are valid according to the network rules but not to the node’s local policy settings.&#x20;

**74. Which is BitcoinSV’s perspective on transaction fees?**

As demand for bitcoins grows, network limitations raise the cost of sending transactions creating a greater incentive for node participation.&#x20;

As transactions become cheaper nodes will need to find new ways of adding value to the network in order to increase the value of their block rewards.&#x20;

When a node hasn’t updated its candidate’s block header to include a newly proposed valid block.&#x20;

When two valid blocks are propagated to the network simultaneously.  ✓

When proof-of-work is wasted on a block that includes the hash of a first seen block that was invalidated through Nakamoto consensus.&#x20;

**83. What is an orphan race?**

A race to extend the chain where more than one valid block is available to be used in the longest chain of proof of work.  ✓

A race to get a proof-of-work from the pool-miner to the node for verification and then onto the network to prevent it from being orphaned.&#x20;

A race to update a node’s mining candidate’s block header in order to prevent any wasted proof-of-work on an already surpassed block.&#x20;

All of the above.&#x20;

**84. How is an orphan race usually resolved?**

When one group of nodes building on a particular block is larger than the other.&#x20;

By discarding both blocks and restarting the block building process.&#x20;

When a block is found in one of the chains before the other.  ✓

All of the above.&#x20;

**85. How are nodes disincentivized from submitting invalid blocks?**

The wasted expense of proof-of-work and the missed opportunity to profit.  ✓

Disconnection from the network impacts their opportunity to earn revenue.  ✓

The loss of energy consumed by finding proof-of-work.  ✓

Even when a block is invalid it still needs to pay the pool-miners.&#x20;

**86. Why do nodes spontaneously form a Small World Network?**

The result of asymmetrical game theory.&#x20;

The financial incentive to quickly and fully propagate transactions and blocks.  ✓

The rules force them to or they will be disconnected from the network.&#x20;

It is still unknown.&#x20;

**87. Which are strong incentives for nodes to have very low latency connections to nodes that are most likely to find a block?**

The First Seen Rule.  ✓

To be able to share and spread block information readily.  ✓

The potential for wasting proof-of-work on an already surpassed previous block hash.  ✓

The minimization of orphan blocks.  ✓

**88. Transaction inputs using particular \_\_\_\_\_\_ can be sorted into specific optimized pipelines. Once the inputs have been validated, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to the block template.**

scriptSig, the transactions is reassembled, its hash added.&#x20;

template types, the transaction is valid, appended.  ✓

Outputs, the inputs, outputs are added.&#x20;

Templates, the templates are reassembled, added.&#x20;

**89. Match the mempool type with the description: This mempool contains transactions that don’t meet the node’s local policies for inclusion in a block, but may meet the requirements of other nodes on the network.**

Main mempool.&#x20;

Secondary mempool.  ✓

Non-final mempool.&#x20;

**90. Match the mempool type with the description: This mempool contains transactions that have been accepted as valid and will be included in the nodes next block.**

Main mempool  ✓

Secondary mempool&#x20;

Non-final mempool&#x20;

**91. Match the mempool type with the description: This mempool may store transactions such as the intermediate states of a payment channel.**

Main mempool&#x20;

Secondary mempool&#x20;

Non-final mempool  ✓

**92. Which of the following are Transaction Consensus Rules? (Part 1)**

nLockTime and nSequence.  ✓

Maximum Input Size Rule.&#x20;

Coinbase Payment Rule.&#x20;

The sum of a transaction's inputs must be greater than, or equal to, that of it’s outputs.  ✓

**93. Which of the following are Transaction Consensus Rules? (Part 2)**

Payment Channels. &#x20;

Maximum Transaction Size Rule.  ✓

Coinbase Maturity Rule.  ✓

Transaction Format Rule.  ✓
