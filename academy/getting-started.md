# Getting Started

BSV is a revolutionary technology and can be quite complex; for most people, it’s a steep learning curve - but it doesn’t have to be. As part of the BSV Association, BSV Academy has curated a range of educational information and resources to establish a curriculum, from which training modules and courses have been developed to best serve the needs of the BSV community.

Our goal is to:

* Strengthen and expand existing sources.
* Grow the overall talent pool and skills base for BSV.
* Offer training appropriate for all skill levels, from introductory BSV blockchain courses through to expert-level material.
* Make it easier to on-board staff for businesses, enterprise and all other industry participants.
* Reinforce blockchain development expertise as a unique and self-regulating profession.

### BSV Essentials

BSV Essentials will give students new to BSV a more introductory perspective on some of the design features, the application of BSV to legacy enterprise and three bridging courses for students to better understand some of the computer science techniques deployed in the system.

#### BSV Basics: Protocol and Design

{% endcontent-ref %}

BSV Basics: Protocol and Design will introduce students to the BSV Ledger, Coins and Transactions and a high level overview of the general theory behind the system.

#### BSV Enterprise

Introduction to BSV Enterprise focuses on the revolutionary potential of BSV Blockchain to radically transform many aspects of legacy enterprise.

#### BSV Primitives

{% endcontent-ref %}

The BSV Primitives courses are to be considered akin to bridging courses for students without a formal background in computer science so that they may fully understand some techniques from the field which have been deployed in BSV Blockchain. These three primitives courses cover Hash Functions, Merkle Trees and Digital Signatures.

### BSV Theory

{% endcontent-ref %}

The BSV Theory stream starts by taking students through the Bitcoin Whitepaper line by line and elaborating on the deeper meanings to ensure a thorough understanding of the Bitcoin system. This course should be considered as a compulsory prerequisite for all deeper study of the Bitcoin protocol as it ensures that everyone who passes the course will have a standardised understanding of the Whitepaper as the technical manifesto of the Bitcoin protocol.

### Introduction to Bitcoin Script

Introduction to Bitcoin Script provides a detailed exploration of the Forth-based scripting language used in the Bitcoin Virtual Machine (Bitcoin VM) during transaction validation. This course guides learners through the functional groups of opcodes in the language, demonstrating how to construct basic script templates and simulate recursive-like behaviors using innovative techniques such as the OP\_PUSHTX methodology.

### BSV Infrastructure

{% endcontent-ref %}

The BSV Infrastructure stream starts with the Introduction to BSV Infrastructure which will be fundamental foundational knowledge for anyone seeking to operate in bitcoin mining or leveraging the network capabilities of BSV to serve as information technology infrastructure. The course takes students through the bitcoin protocol rules to ensure they understand which parameters of the node client they can configure and which are immutable consensus rules that need to be upheld to allow you to operate within the small world network of miners.
