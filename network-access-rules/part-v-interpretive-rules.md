# PART V - INTERPRETIVE RULES

## Part V - Interpretive Rules

1. **Principles of interpretation**\
   \
   The following principles of interpretation apply to the Rules:
   * (a)        references to parties are to the Association and Nodes, and not to any third parties;
   * (b)       references to a person will include a natural person, corporate, or unincorporated body (whether or not such body has a separate legal personality);
   * (c)        references to a company will include any company, corporation, or other body corporate, wherever and however incorporated or established;
   * (d)       a reference to any of a Node’s obligations under the Rules will include an obligation not to procure, permit, or suffer that thing to be done;
   * (e)        a reference to writing or written excludes fax but includes being recorded by any means and, includes email and messages in any human-readable format or representing words in any visible form sent through the Network;
   * (f)        a reference to signing includes an electronic signature, but only where signed through a secure operating system or platform which, in the Association’s reasonable opinion: (i) allows the signature to be uniquely linked to the signatory and capable of identifying them; and (ii) provides a link to the signed data in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable;
   * (g)       any reference to a legal term for any action, remedy, method of judicial proceeding, legal document, legal status, court, official, or any legal concept or thing will, in respect of any jurisdiction other than England and Wales, be deemed to include a reference to that which most nearly approximates to the legal term in that jurisdiction which is equivalent to that in England and Wales;
   * (h)       unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular will include the plural, and words in the plural will include the singular;
   * (i)         unless the context otherwise requires, the words ‘or’ and ‘and’ will be interpreted such that ‘A or B’ means ‘A or B or both,’ ‘either A or B’ means ‘A or B, but not both,’ and ‘A and B’ means ‘both A and B’; and
   * (j)         any words following the terms including, include, in particular, for example, or any similar expression will be interpreted as illustrative and will not limit the sense of the words preceding those terms.
